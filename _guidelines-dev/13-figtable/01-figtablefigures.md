The {% include link elem="fig" %} element groups elements representing or containing graphic information such as an illustration or figure. This element is modelled on the figure element in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). The {% include link elem="fig" %} element is used to contain images, captions, and textual descriptions of the pictures. The images themselves are specified using the {% include link elem="graphic" %} element, whose **@target** attribute provides the location of an image. For example:

{% include mei example="figTable/figTable-sample252.mei" valid="" %}

The graphic element may occur multiple times within the markup of the figure in order to indicate the availablity of different image formats or resolutions:

{% include mei example="figTable/figTable-sample253.mei" valid="" %}
