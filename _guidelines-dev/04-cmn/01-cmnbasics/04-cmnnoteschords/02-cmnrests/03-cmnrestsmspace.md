The {% include link elem="mSpace" %} (measure space) element is closely related to the {% include link elem="space" %} and {% include link elem="mRest" %} elements. It is used to explicitly indicate that a layer has no content but that no information is missing from the encoding.

{% include figure img="ExampleImages/mspace-300-20100514.png" caption="Empty measure" %}
{% include mei example="cmn/cmn-sample105.mei" valid="" %}
