The {% include link elem="mRest" %} (measure rest) element is used to indicate a complete measure rest, independent from the meter of the current

{% include link elem="measure" %}.

The **@cutout** attribute provides for the description of the rendition of the {% include link elem="mRest" %}. If **@cutout** is set to ‘cutout’ (the only value allowed), then the complete staff including the staff lines will not be rendered for this measure.

{% include mei example="cmn/cmn-sample103.mei" valid="" %}

It is a semantic error to mix an {% include link elem="mRest" %} with other events in the same {% include link elem="layer" %}. However, other ‘control events’, such as {% include link elem="fermata" %}, may be used at the same time as {% include link elem="mRest" %}.
