The {% include link elem="multiRest" %} (multiple measure rest) element is used to encode multiple measures of rest. It is commonly used in performer parts, but due to the problem of synchronicity with other staves, it is never found in scores. A numeric value, stored in the **@num** attribute, indicates the number of resting measures. The various visual forms displayed below are not captured by {% include link elem="multiRest" %}, but may be created by rendering software.
