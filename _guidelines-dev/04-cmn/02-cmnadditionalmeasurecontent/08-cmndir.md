In CMN scores, there is often a large number of natural language instructions. Some of them concern the loudness and the speed of the performance, in which case MEI offers the elements {% include link elem="dynam" %} (described at {% include link id="cmnDynam" %}) and {% include link elem="tempo" %}. In other cases, however, they provide other instructions for the performer. Instead of providing separate elements for all possible types of such directions, MEI offers the generic {% include link elem="dir" %} element. Although this element is not CMN specific (it is defined in {% include link id="shared" %}), it is especially important in this repertoire.

A tempo or character indication is often provided above the topmost staff of the first measure of a score, movement, or section. This indication, such as "Allegro moderato" or "Andante maestoso", may be regarded as a label. Though it is possible to label the movement, etc. using a **@label** attribute attached to the enclosing structural entity (that is, on {% include link elem="mdiv" %} or {% include link elem="section" %}), it is often required to capture the exact position, spelling, or other features of the label as found in the underlying source material. In these cases, an element is necessary.

Labels which address the tempo at which the music should be performed should be encoded using the {% include link elem="tempo" %} element, which is a specialized form of {% include link elem="dir" %}. {% include link elem="tempo" %} is a member of the {% include link model="model.controlEventLike" %} class and as such occurs as a child of {% include link elem="measure" %}, following all {% include link elem="staff" %} children. Its **@staff**, **@layer** and **@tstamp** attributes are used to ensure correct semantic positioning, and **@place** indicates a visual position with respect to the staff.

Rehearsal marks are another specialized kind of directive. Consisting of letters, numbers, or a combination of both, rehearsal marks are used in scores and corresponding performer parts to identify convenient points to restart rehearsal after breaks or interruptions. For this reason, they are often visually emphasized by placing them within a square or circle. In MEI, they are encoded using the {% include link elem="reh" %} element, which holds the textual content of the rehearsal mark. The visual rendition of the rehearsal mark, including the surrounding shape, may be captured using the {% include link elem="rend" %} element described in chapter {% include link id="sharedTextRendition" %}.

The following detail from an edition of Hector Berlioz' *Symphonie Fantastique* shows a typical example:

{% include figure img="modules/cmn/reh_berlioz.png" caption="Rehearsal mark" %}
{% include mei example="cmn/cmn-sample160.mei" valid="" %}

The following example demonstrates how rehearsal marks often apply to more than one staff. In this instance, the rehearsal mark is placed above staff 1 and below staves 7 and 11.
