A breath mark indicates a point at which the performer of a wind instrument or singer may breathe. It is sometimes also used to indicate a short pause or break for instruments *not* requiring breath, which allows it to also serve as a guide to phrasing. In MEI, breath marks are encoded using the {% include link elem="breath" %} element, which is a member of {% include link model="model.controlEventLike" %}. It is a semantic error not to specify a starting point attribute.

{% include mei example="cmn/cmn-sample154.mei" valid="" %}

The usual sign for the breath mark is a comma; however, other visual forms of the breath mark may be indicated using the **@altsym** attribute (see chapter {% include link id="userSymbols" %} for further details).
