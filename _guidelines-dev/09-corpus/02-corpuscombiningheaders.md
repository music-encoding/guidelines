An MEI-conformant document may have more than one header only in the case of a TEI corpus, which must have a header in its own right, as well as the obligatory header for each text. Every element specified in a corpus-header is understood as if it appeared within every text header in the corpus. An element specified in a text header but not in the corpus header supplements the specification for that text alone. If any element is specified in both corpus and text headers, the corpus header element is over-ridden for that text alone.

The {% include link elem="titleStmt" %} for a corpus text is understood to be prefixed by the {% include link elem="titleStmt" %} given in the corpus header. All other optional elements of the {% include link elem="fileDesc" %} should be omitted from an individual corpus text header unless they differ from those specified in the corpus header. All other header elements behave identically, in the manner documented in chapter {% include link id="header" %}. This makes it possible to state information which is common to the whole of the corpus in the corpus header, while still allowing for individual texts to vary from this common metadata.

For example, the following markup shows the structure of a corpus consisting of three texts, the first and last of which share the same encoding description. The second one has its own encoding description.

{% include mei example="corpus/corpus-sample211.mei" valid="" %}
