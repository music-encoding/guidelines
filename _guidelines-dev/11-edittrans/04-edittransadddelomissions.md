The following elements are used to indicate when single notational symbols have been omitted from, added to, or marked for deletion from, a musical text. Like the other editorial elements described in this chapter, they allow for a wide range of editorial practices:

  
{% include desc elem="gap" %} 
{% include desc elem="unclear" %} 
{% include desc atts="att.reasonIdent/reason" %} 
{% include desc elem="add" %} 
{% include desc elem="del" %}
