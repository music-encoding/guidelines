Text can be organized in different parts, for example in chapters or sections. The {% include link elem="div" %} element is used to encode such structural divisions.

{% include desc elem="div" %}
{% include desc atts="div/type" %}

For example, printed scores, before the actual notation, can have text that can be organized in multiple sections (e.g. a preface, a critical report, performance instructions, etc. for which see the following sections); each of these sections should be identified by a different {% include link elem="div" %} element. Text might also occur in between music sections (see {% include link id="sharedMdivContent" %}), for example in a collection of romantic piano works, a few pieces might be preceded or followed by poetry. Such text should be encoded with the {% include link elem="div" %} element, as demonstrated in the following example:

{% include mei example="text/text-sample358.mei" valid="" %}

Textual divisions may have titles or other forms of introductory material, which are encoded with the {% include link elem="head" %} element.

{% include desc elem="head" %}

The following example shows the encoding of a preface translated into three different languages, each with a different heading:

{% include mei example="text/text-sample359.mei" valid="" %}

Having said that {% include link elem="div" %} identifies any structural organization of text, it is often helpful to distinguish the typology of division. The attributes **@type** and **@subtype** can be used for this purpose. It is required that **@type** be present when **@subtype** is used, though their values can be freely set by the encoder.

The following example shows the use of **@type** to indicate three prefaces in English, German and Italian are columns on the same page.

{% include mei example="text/text-sample360.mei" valid="" %}
