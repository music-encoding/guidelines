It is common, in many types of texts, to find quotations. A quotation is typically attributed to another text other than the one being encoded. Often, the quoted material is typographically distinct from the surrounding text; i.e., surrounded by so-called ‘quote marks’ or rendered as a separate block of text. The {% include link elem="quote" %} element is used to mark this function:

{% include desc elem="quote" %}

The following examples show the use of {% include link elem="quote" %}.

{% include mei example="text/text-sample365.mei" valid="" %}
{% include mei example="text/text-sample366.mei" valid="" %}
