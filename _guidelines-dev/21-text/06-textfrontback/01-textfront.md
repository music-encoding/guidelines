By ‘front matter’ these Guidelines mean distinct sections of a text (usually, but not necessarily, a printed one), prefixed to it by way of introduction or identification as a part of its production. Features such as title pages or prefaces are clear examples; a less definite case might be the prologue attached to a dramatic work. The front matter of an encoded text should not be confused with the MEI header described in chapter {% include link id="header" %}, which provides metadata for the entire file.

An encoder may choose simply to ignore the front matter in a text, if the original presentation of the work is of no interest. No specific tags are provided for the various kinds of subdivision which may appear within front matter: instead, generic {% include link elem="div" %} (“division”) elements may be used, which should not be confused with {% include link elem="mdiv" %} (“musical division”) elements. The following suggested values for the **@type** attribute may be used to distinguish various kinds of division characteristic of front matter:

{:.gloss}
**'preface'**: A foreword or preface addressed to the reader in which the author or publisher explains the content, purpose, or origin of the text.

{:.gloss}
**'ack'**: A formal declaration of acknowledgement by the author in which persons and institutions are thanked for their part in the creation of a text.

{:.gloss}
**'dedication'**: A formal offering or dedication of a text to one or more persons or institutions by the author.

{:.gloss}
**'abstract'**: A summary of the content of a text as continuous prose.

{:.gloss}
**'contents'**: A table of contents, specifying the structure of a work and listing its constituents. The list element should be used to mark its structure.

{:.gloss}
**'frontispiece'**: A pictorial frontispiece, possibly including some text.

The following extended example demonstrates how various parts of the front matter of a text may be encoded. The front part begins with a title page, which is presented in section {% include link id="textTitlePages" %}, below. This is followed by a dedication and a preface, each of which is encoded as a distinct div:

{% include mei example="text/text-sample368.mei" valid="" %}

The front matter concludes with another {% include link elem="div" %} element, shown in the next example, this time containing a table of contents, which contains a {% include link elem="list" %} element (as described in chapter {% include link id="textLists" %}). Note the use of the {% include link elem="ptr" %} element to provide page-references: the implication here is that the target identifiers (song1, song2, etc.) will correspond with identifiers used for the {% include link elem="mdiv" %} elements containing the individual songs. (For a description of the {% include link elem="ptr" %} element, see chapter {% include link id="ptrRef" %}.)

{% include mei example="text/text-sample369.mei" valid="" %}

Alternatively, the pointers in the table of contents might link to the page breaks at which a song begins, assuming that these have been included in the markup:

{% include mei example="text/text-sample370.mei" valid="" %}
