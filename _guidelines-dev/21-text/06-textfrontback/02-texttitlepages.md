Detailed analysis of the title page and other preliminaries of older printed books and manuscripts is of major importance in descriptive bibliography and the cataloging of printed books; such analysis, however, requires a more detailed approach than the general one described here. The following elements are suggested as a means of encoding the major features of most title pages for faithful rendition:

{% include desc elem="titlePage" %}
{% include desc elem="p" %}
{% include desc elem="table" %}
{% include desc elem="list" %}
{% include desc elem="quote" %}
{% include desc elem="lg" %}

The following example shows the encoding of the title page of Vaughan Williams' *On Wenlock Edge*. Note the use of the {% include link elem="lb" %} element to mark the line breaks present in the original.

{% include mei example="text/text-sample371.mei" valid="" %}

The physical rendition of title page information is often of considerable importance. One approach to this requirement would be to use the {% include link elem="rend" %} element, described in chapter {% include link id="sharedTextRendition" %} to specify the rendition of each of the components of the title page. Another would be to employ a CSS stylesheet. Finally, a module customized for the description of typographic entities such as pages, lines, rules, etc., bearing special-purpose attributes to describe line-height, leading, degree of kerning, font, etc. could be employed.
