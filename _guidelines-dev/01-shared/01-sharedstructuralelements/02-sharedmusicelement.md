MEI texts may be regarded either as unitary; that is, forming an organic whole, or as composite; that is, consisting of several components which are in some important sense independent of each other. The distinction is not always entirely obvious. For example, a collection of songs might be regarded as a single item in some circumstances, or as a number of distinct items in others. In such borderline cases, the encoder must choose whether to treat the text as unitary or composite; each option may have advantages and disadvantages.

Whether unitary or composite, the musical text is marked with the {% include link elem="music" %} tag and may contain front matter, a body, and back matter. In unitary texts, the body is tagged using the {% include link elem="body" %} element; in composite texts, however, where the textual body consists of a series of subordinate musical texts or other groups, it is tagged with the {% include link elem="group" %} element. The overall structure of any musical text, unitary or composite, is thus defined by the following elements:

{% include desc elem="front" %}
{% include desc elem="body" %}
{% include desc elem="group" %}
{% include desc elem="back" %}

Critical editions and collections of works often contain extensive text, such as a title page, table of contents, an introductory essay, commentary, biographical sketch, index, etc. These textual items may appear in either the front or back elements. The front and back elements, available only when the MEI.text module is activated, are described more fully in chapter {% include link id="text" %}.

The overall structure of a single musical text is:

{% include mei example="shared/shared-sample000.mei" valid="" %}

The top-level structure of a composite musical text made up of two unitary musical texts is:

{% include mei example="shared/shared-sample001.mei" valid="" %}
