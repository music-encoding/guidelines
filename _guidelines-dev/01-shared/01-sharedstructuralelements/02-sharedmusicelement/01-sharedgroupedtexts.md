The {% include link elem="group" %} element may be used to represent a collection of independent musical texts which is to be regarded as a single unit for processing or other purposes. It is provided to simplify the encoding of collections, anthologies, and cyclic works. It can also be used to record the potentially complex internal structure of corpora, covered more fully in chapter {% include link id="corpus" %}.

{% include desc elem="group" %}

Examples of composite texts which may be represented using the {% include link elem="group" %} element include anthologies and other collections. The presence of common front matter referring to the whole collection, possibly in addition to front matter relating to each individual musical text, is a good indication that a given musical text might usefully be encoded in this way.

For example, the overall structure of a collection of songs might be encoded as follows:

{% include mei example="shared/shared-sample002.mei" valid="" %}

A group of musical texts may contain other unitary and grouped texts:

{% include mei example="shared/shared-sample003.mei" valid="" %}

The {% include link elem="group" %} element may be used to encode any kind of collection in which the constituents are regarded by the encoder as works in their own right, such as *ad hoc* single- or multiple-composer collections or anthologies of works not originally conceived of as a single composition.
