Addresses may be encoded using the {% include link elem="address" %} element, which itself may hold an arbitrary number of {% include link elem="addrLine" %} elements.

{% include desc elem="address" %}
{% include desc elem="addrLine" %}

It is important to note that the {% include link elem="address" %} element does not hold a reference to the person or organization whose address is specified. This must be provided in a separate element, as in the following example:
{% include mei example="shared/shared-sample010.mei" valid="" %}
