The following element is used in the encoding of bibliographic citations and references:

{% include desc elem="bibl" %}

The {% include link elem="bibl" %} element may contain a mix of text and more specific elements, including the following:

{% include desc elem="annot" %}
{% include desc elem="arranger" %}
{% include desc elem="author" %}
{% include desc elem="biblScope" %}
{% include desc elem="composer" %}
{% include desc elem="creation" %}
{% include desc elem="date" %}
{% include desc elem="distributor" %}
{% include desc elem="edition" %}
{% include desc elem="editor" %}
{% include desc elem="extent" %}
{% include desc elem="funder" %}
{% include desc elem="genre" %}
{% include desc elem="identifier" %}
{% include desc elem="imprint" %}
{% include desc elem="librettist" %}
{% include desc elem="lyricist" %}
{% include desc elem="physLoc" %}
{% include desc elem="publisher" %}
{% include desc elem="pubPlace" %}
{% include desc elem="recipient" %}
{% include desc elem="relatedItem" %}
{% include desc elem="repository" %}
{% include desc elem="respStmt" %}
{% include desc elem="series" %}
{% include desc elem="sponsor" %}
{% include desc elem="textLang" %}
{% include desc elem="title" %}

These elements fall into the following categories:
- identification of the bibliographic entity and those responsible for its intellectual content
- publication and distribution data for the bibliographic entity
- description of the physical characteristics of the item
- annotation of the bibliographic citation and additional details regarding the item's intellectual content

The elements {% include link elem="title" %}, {% include link elem="edition" %}, {% include link elem="series" %}, and {% include link elem="identifier" %} fall into the first category as do the elements {% include link elem="arranger" %}, {% include link elem="author" %}, {% include link elem="composer" %}, {% include link elem="librettist" %}, {% include link elem="lyricist" %}, {% include link elem="funder" %}, {% include link elem="sponsor" %}, and {% include link elem="respStmt" %}. The respStmt element is provided for marking responsibility roles that cannot be recorded using more specific elements. The {% include link elem="biblScope" %} element also carries information of an identifying nature.

The {% include link elem="identifier" %} for a given item may be an International Standard Book/Music Number, Library of Congress Control Number, a publisher's or plate number, a personal identification number, an entry in a bibliography or catalog, etc.

To classify the {% include link elem="title" %} according to some convenient typology, the **@type** attribute may be used. Sample values include: main (main title), subordinate (subtitle, title of part), abbreviated (abbreviated form of title), alternative (alternate title by which the work is also known), translated (translated form of title), uniform (collective title). The **@type** attribute is provided for convenience in analysing titles and processing them according to their type; where such specialized processing is not necessary, there is no need for such analysis, and the entire title, including subtitles and any parallel titles, may be enclosed within a single {% include link elem="title" %} element. Title parts may be encoded in {% include link elem="title" %} sub-elements. The name of the list from which a controlled value is taken may be recorded using the **@authority** attribute.

Publication and distribution data may be captured using {% include link elem="pubPlace" %}, {% include link elem="publisher" %}, {% include link elem="distributor" %}, and {% include link elem="date" %} elements directly inside {% include link elem="bibl" %} when the citation is unstructured. However, these elements should be grouped within {% include link elem="imprint" %} whenever practical.

The physical characteristics of the cited item may be described using the {% include link elem="extent" %} element.

Annotation of the bibliographic citation and the provision of other pertinent details are addressed by several elements. Commentary on the bibliographic item or citation is accommodated by the {% include link elem="annot" %} and {% include link elem="creation" %} elements. The {% include link elem="annot" %} element is provided for generic comments, while {% include link elem="creation" %} is intended to hold information about the context of the creation of the cited item. Terms by which the bibliographic item can be classified may be placed in {% include link elem="genre" %}. For letters and other correspondence, {% include link elem="recipient" %} captures the name of the person or organization to whom the item was addressed. The natural language(s) of the item may be recorded in one or more {% include link elem="textLang" %} elements. Finally, a holding institution may be documented using the {% include link elem="repository" %} element directly within {% include link elem="bibl" %}, but {% include link elem="physLoc" %} should be used whenever possible as a grouping mechanism for location and shelfmark information. To identify sub-units of the holding institution, {% include link elem="repository" %} sub-elements may be used. The name of the list from which a controlled value for the agency name is taken may be recorded using the **@authority** attribute.

When supplied with a **@target** attribute, {% include link elem="bibl" %} may function as a hypertext reference to an external electronic resource. In addition, other related bibliographic items may be described or referenced using the {% include link elem="relatedItem" %} element.
