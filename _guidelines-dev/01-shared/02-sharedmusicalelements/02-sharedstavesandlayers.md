{% include desc elem="staff" %}
{% include desc elem="layer" %}

depends on the repertoire and historical context of the source material. For details
on
their use in Common Western Notation, please refer to chapter {% include link id="cmnMeasures" %}.
For mensural notation, see chapter {% include link id="mensuralData" %}, and for neumatic notation,
