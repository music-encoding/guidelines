When encoding CMN, ornaments should be encoded within a {% include link elem="measure" %}, following the {% include link elem="staff" %} elements, and connected to events on the staff via attributes. The **@startid** attribute is used to refer to the **@xml:id** of the starting note. Additionally, if the ornament involves more than one events on the staff, the **@endid** attribute can be used to anchor the ornament to a concluding event.

The following example demonstrates the encoding of an inverted mordent over a middle C:

{% include mei example="cmnOrnaments/cmnOrnaments-sample192.xml" valid="" %}

Alternatively, the relationship of an ornament to a note can be expressed in terms of beats with the attribute **@tstamp**. If the ornament involves more than one event on the staff, the **@tstamp2** attribute can be used to indicate the ending time stamp, as is explained in section {% include link id="cmnTstamp" %}. These methods may also be utilized simultaneously.

The following example shows the use of **@tstamp** for an ornament. Assuming that the following measure is in 2/2, the ornament (in this case, a mordent) is related to the note on the second beat.

{% include mei example="cmnOrnaments/cmnOrnaments-sample193.xml" valid="" %}

The relationship between an ornament and the notes on staff must always be encoded. It is, in fact, a semantic error not to specify a starting event or time stamp for an ornament.

In their resolution, ornaments will involve auxiliary notes, which typically follow the key signature or the scale of the current key. When the ornament involves other chromatic auxiliaries, an accidental is expressed next to or above the ornament sign. The attributes **@accidlower** and **@accidupper**, available on all ornaments described in this chapter, can be used to record this accidental. The attribute values ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ indicate whether the accidental is associated with an upper or lower auxiliary note, not the position of the accidental sign.
