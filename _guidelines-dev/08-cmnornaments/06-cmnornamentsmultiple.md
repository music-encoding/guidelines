Particularly in baroque keyboard music, but also in the early classical period, various combinations of ornaments can be found. Despite being written vertically above the same note, they are to be performed in sequence.

The following example from C.P.E. Bach's sonata W.62/1 shows a turn followed by a inverted mordent:

{% include figure img="modules/cmnOrnaments/ex_multi_orn.png" caption="Example of multiple ornaments. From C.P.E. Bach's sonata W.62/1." %}

When encoding the example above, both ornaments will be positioned above the same note. The encoded order of the elements, moreover, should correspond to the performed sequence, which in this example is top to bottom: first the turn, then the mordent.
