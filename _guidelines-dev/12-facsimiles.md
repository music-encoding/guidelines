Most often, MEI is used for the preparation of a digital musical text based on an
existing
music document, or with the intention of rendering the encoded notation into a document
or audio
rendition. MEI can, however, be used to provide a different kind of digital reproduction
of a
source document, which relies on the description and provision of digital imagery.
Both
approaches may be combined, so that the encoding of the musical content and digital
facsimiles
may add different facets to the same MEI document.
