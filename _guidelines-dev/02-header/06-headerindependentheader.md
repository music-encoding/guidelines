Many libraries, repositories, research sites and related institutions collect bibliographic
and documentary information about machine readable music documents without necessarily
collecting the music documents themselves. Such institutions may thus want access
to the
header of an MEI document without its attached text in order to build catalogs, indexes
and
databases that can be used to locate relevant texts at remote locations, obtain full
documentation about those texts, and learn how to obtain them. This section describes
a set of
practices by which the metadata headers of MEI documents can be encoded separately
from those
documents and exchanged as freestanding MEI documents. Headers exchanged independently
of the
documents they describe are called independent headers.
