When the FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) module is available, the following elements may be used within {% include link elem="work" %} to describe relationships between the work being described and other works or between the work and expressions of it:

  
{% include desc elem="expressionList" %} 
{% include desc elem="componentGrp" %} 
{% include desc elem="relationList" %} 
 

For more information about FRBR and the use of these elements, see chapter {% include link id="FRBR" %}.
