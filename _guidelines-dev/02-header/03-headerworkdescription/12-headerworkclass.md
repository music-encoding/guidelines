The next component of the core {% include link elem="workDesc" %} element is the {% include link elem="classification" %} element. This element is used to classify a musical text according to one or more of the following methods:

- by reference to a recognized international classification scheme such as the Dewey Decimal Classification, the Universal Decimal Classification, the Colon Classification, the Library of Congress Classification, or any other system widely used in library and documentation work
- by providing a set of keywords, as provided, for example, by British Library or Library of Congress Cataloguing in Publication data.

The following elements are provided for this purpose:

{% include desc elem="termList" %}
{% include desc elem="term" %}
{% include desc elem="classDecls" %}

The {% include link elem="termList" %} element categorizes an individual text by supplying a set of terms which may describe its topic or subject matter, its physical or intellectual form, date, etc. Each term is indicated by a {% include link elem="term" %} element. In some schemes, the order of items in the list is significant, for example, from major topic to minor; in others, the list has an organized substructure of its own. No recommendations are made here as to which method is to be preferred. Wherever possible, such terms should be taken from a recognized source.

The {% include link elem="classDecls" %} element offers the possibility of capturing a bibliographic citation and/or a URI at which the classification scheme or information about it may be found.

{% include mei example="header/header-sample070.mei" valid="" %}
{% include mei example="header/header-sample071.mei" valid="" %}
{% include mei example="header/header-sample072.mei" valid="" %}

The **@term** attribute may be used on each term element to make reference, by means of an identifier, to the classification scheme from which it is drawn.

{% include mei example="header/header-sample073.mei" valid="" %}

Alternatively, **@term** may be used on {% include link elem="termList" %} when all the contained terms come from the same source.

{% include mei example="header/header-sample074.mei" valid="" %}
