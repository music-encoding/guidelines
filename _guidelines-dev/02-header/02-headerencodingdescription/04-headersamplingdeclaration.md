The samplingDecl element holds a prose description of the rationale and methods used in selecting texts, or parts of text, for inclusion in the resource.

{% include desc elem="samplingDecl" %}

The {% include link elem="samplingDecl" %} element should include information about such matters as:

- the size of individual samples
- the method or methods by which they were selected
- the underlying population being sampled
- the object of the sampling procedure used but is not restricted to these.

{% include mei example="header/header-sample051.mei" valid="" %}

It may also include a simple description of any parts of the source text included or excluded:

{% include mei example="header/header-sample052.mei" valid="" %}
{% include mei example="header/header-sample053.mei" valid="" %}

A sampling declaration which applies to more than one text or division of a text need not be repeated in the header of each such text. Instead, the **@decls** attribute of each text (or subdivision of the text) to which the sampling declaration applies may be used to supply a cross-reference to it, as further described in section {% include link id="headerAssociatingMetadataAndData" %}.
