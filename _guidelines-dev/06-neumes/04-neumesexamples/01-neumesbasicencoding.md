The example illustrates the most basic encoding of neume notation. Encoded here is the opening of Hildegarde's "O Splendidissima Gemma" with the text "O splendidissima". Information about the staff has been omitted for brevity, but it was originally encoded on a 5-line staff with two clefs, a "C" and a "F" on lines 5 and 3, respectively.
