The **@pclass** attribute can be used to encode information about the pitch class to which a note belongs. The attribute's value must be an integer less than or equal to 11. It is only allowed on the {% include link elem="note" %} element. The **@pclass** attribute comes from "musical set theory" elaborated first by Howard Hanson and Allen Forte as a new method for organizing tones. It provides a concept for categorizing musical objects (notes) and describing their relationships. It is a kind of grouping and combining, mostly developed in connection with atonal music. However, the concept of set theory is general and can also be applied to tonal music. A pitch class means the summary of every pitch with specific characteristics that means a pitch class set is an unordered collection of pitches, e.g., every pitch with the name C.

A pitch class may contain a large number of pitches, because different octaves and enharmonic spellings of pitch make no difference. The notes C, E, and G would be 0, 4 and 7 in pitch class notation, for example, regardless of the octave in which they are performed. The example below contains the same pitch in four different enharmonic spellings, but all are part of the same pitch class.
