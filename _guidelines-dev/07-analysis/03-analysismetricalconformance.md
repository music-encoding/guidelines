It is often helpful to record whether a given staff, layer, or measure obeys the meter established for it. The following attributes are provided for this purpose:

{% include desc atts="att.meterConformance/metcon" %}
{% include desc atts="att.meterConformance.bar/metcon" %}

When used on {% include link elem="staff" %} or {% include link elem="layer" %} elements, the **@metcon** attribute can be used to indicate if the duration of the contained events is equal to ("c"), less than ("i"), or greater than ("o") that predicted by the time signature. When used on the {% include link elem="measure" %} element, **@metcon** takes a boolean value, where "true" indicates conformance by all staff and layer descendants of the measure.

In the first example below, the layer, staff, and measure all match the prevailing meter. In the second example, however, the first layer does not comply with the meter, making the staff containing it and measure as a whole non-compliant. When there is a single layer or when all the layers on a staff agree with each other, metrical compliance can be indicated on the {% include link elem="staff" %} element. When, however, not all layers have the same value for **@metcon**, then it is necessary to omit **@metcon** at the staff level. The value of **@metcon** on the measure level can usually be computed based on the values of its layer and staff sub-elements.
