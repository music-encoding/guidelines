        This Chapter of the MEI Guidelines is outdated and reflects the older state of the MEI v3 release. 
        It may contradict the current state of the MEI specifications as documented in the Elements, 
        Attribute Classes, Model Classes, Data Types and Macro Groups sections. The Community is currently 
        working to update these Guidelines. Of course, help is greatly appreciated. In case you would like to contribute, please
