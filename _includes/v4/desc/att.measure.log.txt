Logical domain attributes. The n attribute contains a name or number associated with the
      measure (Read, p. 445). Often, this is an integer, but not always. For example, some measures,
      especially incomplete measures or those under an ending mark, may have labels that contain an
      integer plus a suffix, such as '12a'. Measures may even have labels, especially in editorial
      or analytical uses of MEI, that are entirely non-numeric strings. Measure numbers may be
      machine-generated instead of encoding them in the markup. However, an explicit measure number
      should restart numbering with the given value. The join attribute may be used to indicate
      another measure which metrically completes the current, incomplete one.
