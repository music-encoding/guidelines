Through the use of natural-language definitions and examples, this documentation assists users of MEI in achieving effective and consistent markup. Despite translating XML and RNG terminology and concepts into more accessible language, it is still a technical one that presupposes a minimal understanding of XML and music notation. Novice encoders may want to start their MEI experience by doing an introductory tutorial first. These Guidelines will provide recommendations and arguments for encoding different types of music notation for a variety of purposes. While the specification of the framework is complete, the description is not necessarily complete. MEI is used in various contexts, and not every use-case may be fully reflected in these Guidelines. However, MEI is a community effort, so feedback and suggestions for improvement are highly welcome. Several starting points to get in touch with the MEI community can be found on the MEI website . These Guidelines make use of real-world examples to illustrate appropriate encoding concepts. We consider the use of such images as fair use. Contributors to these Guidelines are requested to given proper reference to the libraries holding the material used here.

Grateful acknowledgment is given to the following institutions for their generous contributions: the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur (AdW) in Mainz for serving as hosting institution for the MEI Community, and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for their joint financial support of the MEI project in its early stages. We thank several institutions that hosted Music Encoding Conferences or other MEI-related meetings in the past: The AdW Mainz, the University of Virginia Library, the Biblioteca Umanistica of the Università degli Studi Firenze, McGill University Montréal, the Centre d’études supérieures de la Renaissance Tours, the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) in College Park, the Oxford e-Research Centre, the Universität Paderborn and the Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften Wien in conjunction with the Universität Wien and the Mozarteum Salzburg. We also thank all other institutions that allow their researchers to invest time into both the community and the encoding framework. It is their interest that makes MEI an incredible platform for interchange and scholarly progress. The Text Encoding Initiative is also owed a special debt of gratitude. In addition to providing much of the inspiration for MEI, the TEI organization supplied funding for the MEI Technical Group in its efforts to adopt ODD. The editors of these Guidelines are grateful for those of the TEI, which provided a stellar exemplar and from which we have borrowed shamelessly.

Perhaps the most important additions are the enhancements for the MEI tablature module, particularly the support for German Lute Tablature (GLT). Notable fixes to the guidelines include correcting the description of the optimize attribute on scoreDef to clarify that empty staves are not displayed when its value is set to 'true'. The Release Managers for MEI 5.1 were the Technical Co-Chairs, Benjamin W. Bohl and Stefan Münnich. With MEI 5.1, five additional elements have been added to the schema: tuning , course , string , tabDurSym , and tabGrp . All of these elements are used to encode tablature notation. The use of these elements, including relevant attributes, is documented in the largely rewritten chapter of these Guidelines. The existing att.stringtab.tuning attribute class has been deprecated in favor of these additions and will be removed in a future version of MEI. The new att.dataSelecting class (currently available only on symbolDef ) introduces an XPath-based selection mechanism to identify elements to which certain features apply. All controlevents (see , technically implemented through membership in the att.controlEvent class) are now member of att.color , enabling color customization through the color attribute. Similarly, directive-like elements ( bend , breath , caesura , cpMark , fermata , fing , fingGrp , harm , harpPedal , metaMark , mordent , octave , ornam , trill , and turn ) are now member of the att.verticalGroup class, which gives them access to the vgrp attribute, facilitating vertical alignment.

For scholarly research, this flexibility is necessary and is one of the greatest strengths of MEI. At the same time, we recognize that this flexibility presents challenges for broad adoption of MEI as a notation interchange format. For developers, providing \"full\" MEI support is a difficult and time-consuming chore, writing and supporting code for features which most of their users will not use. Accordingly, MEI has not seen a great deal of adoption by current score-writing applications. This is addressed this with the release of MEI 5. We are now offering a new customization of MEI, MEI Basic , that provides a simplified subset of the MEI framework that reflects the capabilities of most popular \"Common Western Music Notation\" score-writing applications currently in use. In the full MEI schema there are often multiple ways to encode something. MEI Basic simplifies this by providing only one approach for each music feature, making it significantly easier to provide full feature support in software. As noted, MEI Basic only supports Common Western Music Notation. Many of the more complex encoding mechanisms for editorial and analytical workflows are also removed in MEI Basic. MEI Basic has a relatively small footprint of supported features, which may be expanded over time as more software applications adopt MEI and more use cases are identified. All MEI Basic files are valid MEI \"full\" files, meaning MEI Basic files may be expanded and upgraded to MEI \"full\", adding more complex features and encoding mechanisms as required. We hope that this customization facilitates more application adoption, data sharing between MEI projects, and conversion between MEI and other data formats.","url":"content\/introduction.html#meiBasic","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1.1 Guidelines","desc":"","remarks":"With MEI 5, we re-introduce a PDF version of the MEI Guidelines. With a total of more than 5,700 pages, this PDF clearly is not intended to be printed, but may serve as a single-file reference to the current release of MEI. The PDF is interactive, so may be offline with working links between sections. While the largest part of the PDF is taken up by the formal specification of the format, there are also more than 370 pages of prose documentation and examples of how to use the MEI framework for various purposes. The PDF therefore gives a good impression of the huge effort that went into the development of MEI. The Guidelines have also had several notable contributions, led in large part by our Interest Groups. These contributions have sought to make some chapters more clear and consistent, to help newcomers to MEI understand how MEI encoding may be applied. In total, we have over 40 contributors actively involved in the preparation of this release of MEI. Many of them are early-career researchers, investing significant time and effort into the MEI Framework. Due to the open nature of this community work, happening alongside conferences, workshops, and other meetings, others may not be listed properly because of rather informal, but no less important, contributions. Without the joint effort of all those involved, an undertaking like MEI would not be possible.","url":"content\/introduction.html#pdfGuidelines","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1.1 Model changes in MEI","desc":" plica stem divLine repeatMark extData pgHead pgFoot rest mRest mSpace multiRest arpeg scoreDef staffDef","remarks":"MEI 5.0 introduces five new elements: plica and stem , for the encoding of documents written in Mensural notation, and divLine for Neumes documents. The new CMN element repeatMark can be used to express repetition marks as a combination of text and symbols, and the added shared element extData provides a container for non-MEI data formats. The release technically removes the <fingerprint> element, which has been deprecated for ten years. It also removes the elements <pgHead2> and <pgFoot2>, which are now superseded by the func attribute on pgHead and pgFoot respectively. Most other changes affect more specific aspects in the model of MEI, usually expressed in attributes. These include the refinement of the encoding of key signatures, with key.sig moved to keysig , keysig.show moved to keysig.visible , and keysig.showchange and sig.showchange moved to keysig.cancelaccid and cancelaccid respectively. The instr attribute is removed from quiet events like rest , mRest , mSpace and multiRest , and the visible attribute is also removed from mRest . Moreover, attributes line.form and line.width on the arpeg element are aligned with other line-like elements as lform and lwidth . text.dist on scoreDef and staffDef is removed in favor of the newly added attributes dir.dist , reh.dist or tempo.dist . meter.form =\"invis\" is updated to meter.visible =\"false\", and the same change applies to form =\"invis\" on meterSig, now replaced with visible =\"false\". The text-rendition values of letter-spacing and line-height on rend are moved to separate attributes, that is, rend =\"letter-spacing(0.25) line-height(120%)\" will be now letterspacing =\"0.25\" lineheight =\"120%\". Additionally, corrections are applied to specific attribute values, such as changing Bagpipe on midi.instrname to Bag_pipe and replacing dblwhole on head.mod with fences . All changes can be traced in the detailed Release Notes auto-generated from the Pull Requests on GitHub. A larger group of changes affects the internal class structure of MEI only, where significant effort went into improved consistency in naming things. While this set of changes does not affect end users of MEI during validation of files, they may have consequences for local customizations which reference classes not available anymore. If you have advanced local customizations based on MEI v4 or older releases, please check that the rules provided still work as expected under v5.

These changes are designed to help improve the development workflow of MEI, improving consistency and oversight of changes as they are contributed to MEI. Our new setup is explained in great detail in the project README file . We have also expanded our Contribution Guidelines and other documentation files in the music-encoding GitHub repository . The MEI documentation and guidelines are now expressed in TEI ODD again, moving away from the MarkDown-based approach used in the preparation of MEI v4 documentation. This re-introduces greater compatibility with the TEI toolset. The source code for both the Guidelines and the Specification is now jointly contained in the music-encoding GitHub repository , which simplifies validation across both parts of MEI. All assets – web documentation, PDF Guidelines, and schemata – are automatically generated from there. A multi-platform Docker image for running these processes locally is also provided to help new developers with getting started in contributing to MEI. Setting up these technical workflows has taken considerable effort, but should now simplify future development and releases considerably. In addition to the main Music Encoding schema and Guidelines, we have also updated our Sample Encodings and Encoding Tools repositories. Sample Encodings have been updated to MEI 5.0, and several problems with encodings from older releases have been fixed. In the Encoding Tools, several bugs were fixed with older upgrade XSLT scripts, and a new XSLT for upgrading MEI 4 to MEI 5 was added.

Bent, et al. \"Notation.\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 25 May 2010. http:\/\/www.oxfordmusiconline.com\/subscriber\/article\/grove\/music\/20114 .) However, MEI’s understanding is more inclusive than this restrictive definition, i.e. , Braille certainly qualifies as music notation documents. The encoding scheme permits both the creation of new music notation documents and the conversion of existing ones from print and other electronic formats. However, conversion of existing documents may require revisions in content or rearrangement of information.","url":"content\/introduction.html#definitionsAndParameters","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 General Principles","desc":"","remarks":"MEI may be used to encode both primary sources of music notation, such as an autograph or published score, and secondary sources, such as a scholarly edition based on one or more primary sources. The format encompasses both use cases, and the encoder must choose the elements and attributes most appropriate in each case. These Guidelines aim to provide guidance on that task. As an encoded representation of one or more music notation documents, an MEI file may be employed as a surrogate for the original materials. Although the encoding scheme does not define or prescribe intellectual content for music notation documents, it does define content designation and is intended to be used with available data content standards. MEI identifies the essential data elements within music notation documents and establishes codes and conventions necessary for capturing and distinguishing information within those elements for future action or manipulation. While there are a few elements that ought to appear in any MEI document, various intellectual, technical, and economic factors influence the level of detail of analysis and encoding actually undertaken. Taking this into consideration, the encoding scheme is designed with a minimum of required elements and allows for progressively more detailed levels of description as desired. The encoding scheme preserves and enhances the current functionality of existing music notation documents. It permits identification of document structures and content that support description, navigation, analysis, and online and print presentation. The encoding scheme is intended to facilitate interchange between notational tools. It aims to assist in the creation of more effective and consistent encoding, encourage the creation of cooperatively-created and widely available databases of music notation documents, and permit the reuse of encoded data for multiple output purposes. It will also ensure that machine-readable music notation documents will outlive changing hardware and software environments because they are based on a platform-independent standard.","url":"content\/introduction.html#generalPrinciples","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 Structural Features","desc":"","remarks":"The encoding scheme is based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML), a text-based format for representing structured information. It is expressed as a One Document Does-it-all (ODD) document. For more information on ODD, please refer to . Related or complementary standards, such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange , the Encoded Archival Description (EAD) , MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data , existing notation encoding schemes, etc. have been consulted and employed as appropriate. For example, the data model includes a header that is comparable to the TEI header, and TEI and EAD naming conventions and tag structures have been used whenever feasible. However, while some feature names are similar, or even the same, it is important to recognize that MEI and TEI have different semantic scope. Obviously, a note element in MEI does not carry the same meaning as the element of the same name in TEI. Perhaps less obviously, a phrase in music notation is unrelated to a textual phrase. With respect to metadata, MEI recognizes the close relationship between the metadata content found in the MEI header and that of catalog records, authority records, and finding aids. Therefore MEI provides ways of indicating in the encoding the corresponding fields of other metadata standards. To ensure broad international and multi-repertoire application of MEI, existing musical terminology was used in building the data model where practical. When appropriate, a more neutral terminology was used to facilitate sharing of concepts and thus stressing the commonalities between different repertoires. Finally, extensive use of attributes and clearly-defined classification mechanisms in the schema permits the refinement of element meanings within specific musical, geographic, or temporal contexts.","url":"content\/introduction.html#structuralFeatures","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 Control and Maintenance","desc":"","remarks":"The Music Encoding Initiative Community has given itself By-laws , which regulate all essential properties and procedures.

In 1965, Milton Babbitt distinguished between graphemic , acoustic and auditory aspects of music (Babbitt, Milton: The Use of Computers in Musicological Research , in: Perspectives of New Music 3\/2 (1965), p. 76). Various music encoding formats took up this distinction, most notably SMDL, the Standard Music Description Language (ISO\/IEC DIS 10743). While the format itself was hardly ever used for its impractical implementation details, parts of its design certainly influenced the development of other formats, including MEI. In a documentation draft ( http:\/\/xml.coverpages.org\/smdl10743-pdf.gz, p.5 ), SMDL identifies four different musical domains : logical domain The logical domain is the basic musical content – the essence from which all performances and editions of the work are derived, including virtual time values, nominal pitches, etc. The logical domain is describable as “the composer’s intentions with respect to pitches, rhythms, harmonies, dynamics, tempi, articulations, accents, etc.,” and it is the primary focus of SMDL. It can also be described as “the abstract information common to both the gestural and visual domains.” […] gestural domain The gestural domain is comprised of any number of performances, each of which may specify how and when components of the logical domain is rendered in a specific performance, including all the means whereby the performer actually “expresses” (acoustically instantiates) the music (intonation, agogic and dynamic stress, etc.). The gestural domain is perhaps most succinctly described as “the information added by performers,” or “how the music actually sounds during particular performances.” […] visual domain The visual domain is comprised of any number of scores, each of which somehow specifies exactly how components of the logical domain is rendered visually in some particular printable (and\/or displayable) edition, including such graphical details as symbology, symbol sets, fonts, page layout, beaming conventions and exceptions, etc. The visual domain is perhaps most succinctly described as “the information added by human editors, engravers, and typesetters,” or “how the music actually looks in some particular edition.” […] analytical domain The analytical domain is comprised of any number of theoretical analyses and\/or commentaries, each of which somehow specifies opinions, exegeses, etc. about any or all of the information in the other three domains. […] On a generic level, MEI follows the same definition, and it definitely shares the same terminology. However, not all four domains are available throughout the MEI schema, and quite frequently, two domains fall together in MEI. Very often, MEI prioritizes the visual domain over the gestural domain by (partly) conflating the logical and the visual domains . For example, MEI utilizes the pname (pitch name) attribute on notes to capture the written pitch of a note, whereas the sounding pitch may be described with the pname.ges attribute. Here, the logical and visual domains go without a special indication, whereas the gestural domain is identified by a special suffix. However, in case of transposing instruments, additional markup (namely the attributes trans.diat and trans.semi from MEI’s attribute class att.staffDef.log ) will create a distinction between the logical and visual domain (see chapter ). In that case, pname will be restricted to the visual domain, while the logical aforementioned attributes provide additional information for the logical domain. Even though the technical implementation of MEI prioritizes the visual domain to some degree, this does not mean that any given encoding has to provide visual information. MEI takes no assumption on what data is required: While an OMR project ( optical music recognition ) may generate strictly visually oriented data only, another project focussed on audio transcriptions may generate gestural data only. A third project could integrate both approaches. In order to avoid ambiguous encodings, MEI is very strict and specific on the scope of its individual markup elements. For an encoder, the suffixes mentioned above provide clear hints on which domain is addressed by specific markup: Many attributes carry a suffixed .log (logical), .ges (gestural), .vis (visual), or .anl (analytical) in their name. In addition, the internal structure of MEI heavily relies on those different domains. When customizing MEI (see chapter ), it is possible to turn off either visual or gestural domain encoding completely. That way, MEI allows to address the four most eminent musical domains specifically and independent of each other.","url":"content\/introduction.html#musicalDomains","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 Events and Controlevents","desc":" note rest chord dynam tempo dir slur tie layer measure staff hairpin att.startId att.startEndId att.timestamp.log att.timestamp2.log","remarks":"MEI differentiates between two essential aspects of music notation: Events and ControlEvents . There are other examples for such a separation of concerns with regard to music. In Greg’s Copy-Text Theory (W.W. Greg: The Rationale of Copy-Text , 1950), a distinction between primary and secondary text is made; similar attempts have been made for music specifically. In MEI, elements describing the basic musical text are referred to as Events . They are the building blocks for the stream of music – mostly those are note s, rest s, and chord s. In contrast, ControlEvents make no independent contribution to that flow of music. Instead, they provide additional information about the encoded Events , they control their performance. Examples for such ControlEvents are dynam ic markings, tempo s indications, or performance dir ectives. Depending on the encoding strategy used, slur s and tie s often also fall into this category (they may be encoded as attributes instead, in which case they become a property of the basic events). Simply put, Events describe what needs to be performed, and ControlEvents indicate how it needs to be performed. In ( -based) MEI, Events are nested inside a layer element, while ControlEvents are direct children of the first measure they apply to, following all staff elements there. These structural differences result in different markup concepts. As Events are encoded inside layer s, their semantic position inside the encoded work can be derived from their structural position – the measure, staff and layer they're nested in, and within that layer by their position inside the sequence of all layer children. As mentioned above, it is highly recommended to encode ControlEvents inside the first measure they apply to, but they still require references to the actual events they apply to. There are two common concepts to provide such a connection, both of which offering specific benefits and drawbacks. A technically very stable connection between ControlEvents and Events can be established by using pointers . In this case, all events that need to be referenced need an xml:id attribute, which holds a globally unique identifier for this very element. The referencing controlevent then uses a startid and, if necessary, endid attribute to create a link to where in the stream of music it is supposed to start or end. The dynam element uses startid to reference the xml:id of the second quarter in the given measure <measure n=\"10\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <note pname=\"f\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\"\/> <note pname=\"g\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\" xml:id=\"c4ded06ff\"\/> <note pname=\"a\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\"\/> <note pname=\"c\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"4\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <dynam startid=\"#c4ded06ff\">f<\/dynam> <\/measure> In the example above, the dynam element references the second quarter in the given measure. Additional attributes like place may be used to describe the position of the forte indication within the score. A hairpin element may use the endid attribute to indicate the duration of the hairpin using the same mechanism as above. A ControlEvent encoded like above will be strictly tied to the referenced Events – if their position inside the XML document changes for whatever reason, they will keep that connection. This means that the semantic position to which they are bound may change without affecting the binding. An example could be an inserted additional note in front – the dynamic marking would not start on the second quarter, but perhaps on the third instead. As this behavior may not be desired in all cases, an alternative binding between ControlEvents and Events is possible, relying on timestamps instead. This mechanism is illustrated in the following example: The dynam element uses staff , layer and tstamp to indicate the place of the dynamic <measure n=\"10\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note pname=\"f\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\"\/> <note pname=\"g\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\"\/> <note pname=\"a\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\"\/> <note pname=\"c\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"4\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <dynam staff=\"1\" layer=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\">f<\/dynam> <\/measure> Here, no xml:id is required on notes. Instead, the dynam element uses the staff and layer attributes to indicate to which set of events the following tstamp attribute refers to. This mechanism actually depends on what has been only recommended above: placing the controlevent inside the measure where it starts. The startid reference mechanism would work equally well if all controlevents where positioned in the very first or last measure, or actually even inside a separate file. The tstamp references however would not, they depend on correct placement of the controlevents inside the XML tree. For consistency, it is therefore recommended to always use this placement. The benefit of this concept is that controlevents are tied to a semantic position , but not necessarily to a given XML element. The forte may still be placed on the second quarter, even though the composer may have replaced that quarter G4 with a different pitch and \/ or duration. Actually, it is not required that an Event can be found at the position indicated by a timestamp. This may be useful to encode a slur ending at an arbitrary position between two events, or dynam markings spread across otherwise empty measures. If the ending of a ControlEvent shall be given by timestamp, the tstamp2 attribute is used. Because of potential inconsistencies, an encoding should not offer both startid and tstamp or endid and tstamp2 . Though not being recommendable, it is possible to mix startid with tstamp2 and tstamp with endid . In general, it is easier for software to process startid and endid . When no other arguments apply, using xml:id -based pointers is therefore the most common way to connect ControlEvents with Events . The details on how timestamps are calculated and used in MEI are given in .","url":"content\/introduction.html#eventsControlevents","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 Timestamps in MEI","desc":" slur att.timestamp.log att.timestamp2.log","remarks":"In MEI, timestamps are treated in a slightly simplified way: they have no notion of beat . Instead, timestamps rely solely on the numbers given in the meter signature. In a measure of 4\/4, timestamps will range from 1 to 4. The second eighth note will be 1.5 in this case. If the same measure would be given in 2\/2, it would be 1.25 instead. At this point, MEI uses real numbers only to express timestamps. In case of (nested or complex) tuplets, this solution is inferior to fractions because of rounding errors. It is envisioned to introduce a fraction-based value for timestamps in a future revision of MEI. For now, it is recommended to round the fractional part of the number to no more than five digits to avoid such problems. Durations may also be expressed based on timestamps. In this case, the values are a combination of the count of measures that need to be moved forward to reach the measure in which an encoded feature ends, and the timestamp within that measure. The encoding contains a number of slur examples illustrating durations expressed by timestamps <!-- slur starting on timestamp 1, ending on timestamp 4 of the same measure --> <slur tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"0m+4\"\/> <!-- slur ending on timestamp 1 of the following measure --> <slur tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"1m+1\"\/> <!-- slur ending on timestamp 2.5 in the second next measure --> <slur tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"2m+2.5\"\/> Sometimes, timestamps are used to indicate positions where no music Events are located (see ). Therefore, the allowed range of timestamps stretches from 0 to the current meter count + 1. By definition, a timestamp of 0 indicates the position of the left bar line, while a timestamp of 5 (in case of a 4\/4 meter) indicates the right bar line. This makes it possible to encode open-ended slurs in a graphical way. However, it should be kept in mind that such timestamps may not be converted to startid and endid , and not every application may be able to render them correctly, even though they are perfectly valid MEI, and sometimes are necessary to faithfully transcribe a source.","url":"content\/introduction.html#timestamps","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 MEI Profiles","desc":"","remarks":"MEI is an encoding framework, not a data format. This means that MEI provides recommendations for encoding music documents, but it depends on the encoder's needs and requirements to which features and solutions are appropriate to the task and should be used. MEI offers specific models for different notation types and music repertoires, but it is rarely advisable to use them all side by side in one encoding. In order to use MEI, it is advised to use a restricted version of the schema, which will make it easier both for an encoder and a reader of the encoded files. MEI provides a number of pre-defined profiles , which focus on specific uses of MEI while still maintaining a great level of flexibility. For projects that need even better control over their data, it is highly recommended to create a more specific customized version of MEI (see chapter ). The following customizations are provided with every release of MEI: mei-CMN For most users, this will be the best starting point into music encoding with MEI. The mei-CMN customization targets at documents that use Common Western Music Notation . The specific rules for that notation are specified in chapter , even though other chapters of these Guidelines apply as well. mei-Mensural For documents written in Mensural Notation (both black and white), MEI offers the mei-Mensural customization. The specific rules for that notation are specified in chapter , even though other chapters of these Guidelines apply as well. mei-Neumes This profile allows to encode medieval Neume Notation with MEI. The specific rules for that notation are specified in chapter , even though other chapters of these Guidelines apply as well. Please note that the mei-Neumes profile has undergone significant changes from MEI version 3 to version 4. mei-Basic As an encoding framework, MEI offers multiple approaches to encode certain features at various levels of detail. While this flexibility is at the core of MEI and often required for research projects, it is an obstacle when developing software and converters for MEI. The mei-Basic profile is a subset of MEI which restricts it to one way of encoding for every feature of music notation. It covers Common Western Music Notation only, and excludes all editorial markup. In essence, it has the same functionality as most other music encoding formats like MusicXML or MNX. The purpose of mei-Basic is to serve as common ground for data interchange, both between projects using different profiles of MEI, and other encoding schemes. mei-all This is the full definition of MEI. It includes all different repertoires, which has certain side effects and enables encoding options that are neither intended nor advocable. For example, in mensural notation music is organized by staves. In contrast, Common Music Notation utilizes measures, which in turn contain staves. These staves have a different meaning here, and are modeled differently in MEI. mei-all mixes those models and thus invites encoding errors. In general, you should almost never use mei-all except for testing purposes. mei-all_anyStart This profile includes all of mei-all , but extends it even further so that it allows any MEI element as root of conforming MEI instances. In regular MEI, the only allowed starting elements are mei , meiHead , music and meiCorpus . The sole purpose of this customization is to simplify validation at tutorial sessions and other educational purposes. It should not be used in production. The first three profiles provide good starting points to encode music from the respective repertoires. They may also serve as template for further, project-specific customizations. The latter two profiles target very specific use cases and should not be used by default.","url":"content\/introduction.html#meiProfiles","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 Customizing MEI","desc":"","remarks":"In production, it is best to use a customized version of MEI, restricted to the very needs of a project. Such a custom schema will guide the encoders and will help to ensure consistency and data quality throughout a project’s files. A customization typically provides a subset of MEI’s encoding models (typically starting from one of the official profiles mentioned in chapter ), with only one solution for any given situation being allowed. The customization will help to reflect the scope of a project into its data: Only those aspects of music notation a project is interested in will be allowed, so that the absence of a specific information can not be misunderstood as an oversight of the encoders. Larger editorial projects like Complete Works editions typically use Editorial Guidelines (german: Editionsrichtlinien ) for the same purposes: (internal) quality control and (external) documentation. In that sense, MEI customizations may serve as Editorial Guidelines in digital form. MEI is implemented in ODD. ODD, or One Document Does-it-all , is another XML-based markup language developed and maintained by the TEI. TEI's documentation for ODD can be found in the TEI Guidelines chapter 22: Documentation Elements , chapter 23: Using the TEI , and the \" Getting Started with P5 ODDs \" document. At this point, there is no specific documentation on how to customize MEI with ODD beyond the generic TEI documentation. However, the provided are based on ODD customizations, and may serve as starting point for further project-specific restrictions. They can be found at https:\/\/github.com\/music-encoding\/music-encoding\/tree\/stable\/customizations . In addition, several projects have shared their customizations on GitHub, such as Freischütz Digital or Beethovens Werkstatt . MEI provides a web service at http:\/\/custom.music-encoding.org which allows to compile such customizations against the MEI sources in order to generate RelaxNG schemata, which can be used for validation.

It contains an meiHead element for capturing metadata and a music element for describing the musical text. A more detailed description of the application of music can be found in the course of this section (see ). If you want to learn more about the use of the meiHead element – formally declared in the MEI.header module – please visit the chapter in the section. The below example shows the basic structure of an MEI file with mei as root element. Please be aware that this example still does not represent a valid MEI file: Basic structure of an MEI file <mei xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.music-encoding.org\/ns\/mei\" meiversion=\"6.0-dev\"> <meiHead> <!-- metadata goes here --> <\/meiHead> <music> <!-- description of musical text goes here --> <\/music> <\/mei> The other potential root elements serve different use cases or purposes. A document with music as root element provides music notation markup without metadata, and could serve embedding MEI within other kinds of markup, e.g. , TEI (see ). The below example shows the basic structure of an MEI file with music as root element. Basically this already represents a valid MEI file, although without any contents: Basic structure of an MEI file with music as root element <music xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.music-encoding.org\/ns\/mei\" meiversion=\"6.0-dev\"> <!-- description of musical text goes here --> <\/music> meiCorpus contains an meiHead element describing a collection of related MEI-encoded texts – known as a corpus – and an mei element for each text.

Although not required the att.meiVersion attribute is important for defining a stable reference to a specific MEI-version used in the enclosed encoding, and thus is highly recommended on your root element.","url":"content\/shared.html#sharedDocumentElements","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1 General Music Structure Elements","desc":" music body group front back performance genDesc facsimile","remarks":"As indicated above, the general place for encoding the musical text is the music element. MEI.shared offers two possible child elements: While body holds the contents of a single musical text, group allows the textual body to consists of a series of (subordinate) musical texts or other e.g. , to represent a collection of independent musical texts which is to be regarded as a single unit for processing or other purposes. It is provided to simplify the encoding of collections, anthologies, and cyclic works. It can also be used to record the potentially complex internal structure of corpora, covered more fully in chapter . Whether the musical text being encoded should be structured one way or the other is not to be decided here. For example, a collection of songs might be regarded as a single item in some circumstances, or as a number of distinct items in others. In such borderline cases, the encoder must choose whether to treat the text as unitary or composite; each option may have advantages and disadvantages. There are several more possible child elements of the music element defined in other modules of MEI, such as front and back elements (defined in MEI.text module, cf. ), performance (defined in MEI.performance module, cf. ), genDesc (defined in MEI.genetic module, cf. ), facsimile (defined in MEI.facsimile module, cf. ). Please be aware that the following examples still do not reflect valid MEI files as they are missing some required elements not defined in the MEI.shared module. The basic structure of a unitary musical text <mei> <meiHead> <!-- metadata goes here --> <\/meiHead> <music> <front> <!-- front matter of text, if any, goes here --> <\/front> <body> <!-- body of text goes here --> <\/body> <back> <!-- back matter of text, if any, goes here --> <\/back> <\/music> <\/mei> Examples of composite texts which may be represented using the group element include anthologies and other collections. The presence of common front matter referring to the whole collection, possibly in addition to front matter relating to each individual musical text, is a good indication that a given musical text might usefully be encoded in this way. For example, the overall structure of a collection of songs might be encoded as follows: The group element groups together a sequence of distinct musical texts <music> <group> <music> <!-- song 1 --> <\/music> <music> <!-- song 2 --> <\/music> <!-- additional songs here --> <\/group> <\/music> A group of musical texts may contain other unitary and grouped texts: The group element contains unitary and grouped texts <music> <group> <music> <!-- song 1 --> <\/music> <group> <!-- songs sharing one or more characteristics, treated as a group --> <music> <!-- song 2 --> <\/music> <music> <!-- song 3 --> <\/music> <\/group> <\/group> <\/music> The group element may be used to encode any kind of collection in which the constituents are regarded by the encoder as works in their own right, such as ad hoc single- or multiple-composer collections or anthologies of works not originally conceived of as a single composition.","url":"content\/shared.html#sharedMusicElement","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1.1 Divisions of the Body","desc":" body mdiv att.typed att.classed","remarks":"This section describes sub-division of the body of a musical text. Front and back matter are described in chapter . The body of a unitary musical text may contain one or more discrete, linear segments. The names commonly used for these structural subdivisions vary with the genre, style, and time period of the music, or even at the whim of the author, editor, or publisher. For example, a major subdivision of a symphony is generally referred to as a ‘movement’. An opera, on the other hand, is usually organized into ‘acts’ and then further by ‘scenes’. All such divisions are treated as occurrences of the same neutrally-named mdiv element. The attributes type or class may be used to categorize them independently of their hierarchic level. To accommodate \"divisions within divisions\", an mdiv element may contain additional mdiv sub-elements nested to any level required. For example, the encoding of a multi-movement work, such as a symphony, might have the following structure: The mdiv element contains additional mdiv sub-elements <body> <mdiv type=\"symphony\"> <mdiv n=\"1\" type=\"movement\"> <!-- contents of mvt 1 --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"2\" type=\"movement\"> <!-- contents of mvt 2 --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"3\" type=\"movement\"> <!-- contents of mvt 3 --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"4\" type=\"movement\"> <!-- contents of mvt 4 --> <\/mdiv> <\/mdiv> <\/body> While dramatic works, such as Verdi's opera, Il Trovatore , often exhibit a more deeply-nested structure: The use of mdiv elements can create a deeply-nested structure <body> <mdiv type=\"opera\"> <mdiv n=\"I\" type=\"act\"> <mdiv n=\"1\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act I, sc. 1 --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"2\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act I, sc. 2--> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"3\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act I, sc. 3 --> <\/mdiv> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"II\" type=\"act\"> <mdiv n=\"1\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act II, sc. 1 --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"2\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act II, sc. 2 --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"3\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act II, sc. 3 --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"4\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act II, sc. 4 --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"5\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act II, sc. 5 --> <\/mdiv> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"III\" type=\"act\"> <mdiv n=\"1\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act III, sc. 1 --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"2\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act III, sc. 2 --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"3\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act III, sc. 3 --> <\/mdiv> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"IV\" type=\"act\"> <mdiv n=\"1\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act IV, sc. 1 --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"2\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act IV, sc. 2 --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv n=\"3\" type=\"scene\"> <!-- contents of act IV, sc. 3 --> <\/mdiv> <\/mdiv> <\/mdiv> <\/body> Conventionally, in performance the musical structures represented by mdiv elements are separated by pauses; however, attacca , attacca subito , seque , or similar terms are sometimes used at the end of an mdiv to indicate that the next mdiv should begin immediately after the conclusion of the current one. These terms have no effect, however, on the logical segmentation of musical content using mdiv elements.","url":"content\/shared.html#sharedDivisionsBody","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1.1 Content of Musical Divisions","desc":" mdiv score parts part staffGrp scoreDef staffDef section ending staff layer measure barLine expansion lem rdg","remarks":"The contents of mdiv can be organized according to the two encoding paradigms provided by the score and parts elements. The score element represents notation in which all the parts of an ensemble are arranged on vertically aligned staves, while the parts element collects the individually notated parts for each performer or group of performers. The explicit encoding of these two ‘views’ is necessary because it is not always possible or desirable to automatically derive one view from the other. In addition, separating scores and parts can eliminate a great deal of markup complexity. The contents of mdiv organized by score and parts elements <body> <mdiv n=\"1\" type=\"movement\"> <score> <!-- markup of score goes here --> <\/score> <parts> <!-- markup of performers’ parts goes here --> <\/parts> <\/mdiv> <!-- additional movements go here --> <\/body> The score and parts elements may also be employed to accommodate different methods of organizing the markup – with no particular presentation implied. In this case, software may render a collection of parts as a score or a score as a collection of parts. Within the collective parts element, notation for a single performer is represented by the part element: A part is effectively a small-scale score, allowing all the encoding features of a full score, such as multiple staves, performance directives, and so on. A group of part elements is useful for encoding performing parts when there is no score, such as in early music part books; when the parts have non-aligning bar lines; when different layout features, such as page turns, are needed for the score and parts; or for accommodating software that requires part-by-part encoding. Please note that part elements in MEI are not an indication of voice leading or staff grouping. Voice leading can be encoded using the next attribute, available on all the members of the model.eventLike class. The staffGrp element handles grouping of staves in the score context. The collective parts element with a group of part elements <parts> <part label=\"Violin 1\"> <!-- first performer’s part --> <\/part> <part label=\"Violin 2\"> <!-- second performer’s part --> <\/part> <!-- additional performers’ parts --> <\/parts> In both score and part views, the scoreDef element is used to describe logical characteristics of the encoded music, such as key signature, the sounding key (as opposed to the notated key signature), meter, etc., and visual features, such as page size, staff groupings and display labels, etc. The staffGrp elements within scoreDef and the order of staffDef elements inside staffGrp should follow the score order of the source for the encoding. A part or score may be further divided into linear segments called \"sections\". section elements are often used as a scoping mechanism for clef signs, key and meter signatures, as well as metronome, tempo, and expression markings. Using section elements can help to minimize the need for backward scanning to establish context when the starting point for access is not at the beginning of the score. section elements may also be used for other user-defined, i.e. , analytical or editorial, purposes and may therefore be arbitrarily nested to any desired level. The ending element shares the same model as the section element. Unlike section , however, it may not be recursively nested. The most common (non-analytical, non-editorial) use of section and ending elements is illustrated below: The content of score organized with section and ending elements <music> <body> <mdiv> <score> <section> <!-- section one to be repeated --> <\/section> <ending n=\"1\"> <!-- 1st ending --> <\/ending> <ending n=\"2\"> <!-- 2nd ending --> <\/ending> <section> <!-- next section --> <\/section> <\/score> <\/mdiv> <\/body> <\/music> Within section elements, several methods of organization are possible, depending upon the notational style of the source material and the encoder's needs. For example, when the MEI.cmn module is used, the default organization is measure-by-measure, with staff and layer sub-elements within each measure . Further discussion of CMN notation is continued in chapter . However, staff-by-staff organization is more appropriate for music without measures and is provided when either the MEI.mensural or MEI.neumes module is employed. Coverage of mensural notation is provided in chapter , while describes neumatic notation. It must be noted that, when both the MEI.cmn and MEI.mensural modules are available, it is possible to encode CMN notation without using measure elements; that is, staff-by-staff organization may be used and the ends of measures marked using barLine elements. In certain circumstances, this approach may be preferable for reproduction of the visual layout of the music. However, the simultaneous use of the measure and barLine elements may lead to confusion and should be avoided. Typically, MEI follows the order of sections as they appear in the document being encoded. When performance requires a different order, for instance in the case of D.C. and D.S. directives, the following element may be used to define the performance order. In the following example, expansion is used to indicate how the notated sections should be ordered in a \"through-composed\" rendition, for example for machine performance or analysis. The plist attribute contains an ordered list of identifiers of descendant section , ending , lem , or rdg elements. The sequence of values in the plist attribute indicates that the section labelled 'A' comes first, then the section labelled 'B', followed by the 'A' section again. This mechanism must be specified independently of any textual directives, such as \"Da capo\" or \"D.S. al Fine\", that may be present in the document. The expansion element uses the content of plist to indicate how the notated sections should be ordered <music> <body> <mdiv> <score> <section> <expansion plist=\"#shared.A #shared.B #shared.A\"\/> <section xml:id=\"shared.A\"> <!-- \"A\" section --> <\/section> <section xml:id=\"shared.B\"> <!-- \"B\" section --> <\/section> <\/section> <\/score> <\/mdiv> <\/body> <\/music>","url":"content\/shared.html#sharedMdivContent","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1 Document Layout Elements","desc":" pb pgDesc pgHead pgFoot sb front back att.nNumberLike att.formework cb colLayout","remarks":"This section introduces the elements that can be used to represent document layout features in MEI, be it for the sake of capturing an original source's layout when transcribing or setting up layout features in so called ‘born digital’ documents.

It need not be an integer, e.g. , 'iv', or 'p17-3'. The logical page number can be calculated by counting previous pb ancestor elements.

Often, a slur also indicates that the affected notes should be played in a legato manner. Even so, it is common for both of these concepts to be referred to generically as \"slurs\".

MEI redefines some of them in the att.basic class. The value of the xml:id attribute serves as an identifier for an element and its content. Its value must be unique in the context of the current document and must conform to the definition of an XML Name provided by the W3C Recommendation at http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/xml\/#NT-Name . Suggestions for constructing an xml:id value can be found at http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/xml\/#sec-suggested-names . The xml:id attribute may take values similar to the following: Valid values for xml:id <!-- The following are all valid IDs. --> <note xml:id=\"n1\"\/> <note xml:id=\"_n1\"\/> <note xml:id=\"thisIsMyFavoriteNote\"\/> <note xml:id=\"shared.thisIsMyFavoriteNote\"\/> This is an example of an incorrectly-formulated xml:id value: Invalid value for xml:id <!-- xml:id not valid as IDs are not allowed to start with a number. --><note xml:id=\"1\"\/> At many locations in an MEI file one can reference internal or external references. E.g. the following example defines a graphic and references an external image (entity) by means of the target attribute: The graphic element uses target <graphic target=\"myImage.jpg\"\/> When a reference to an external entity is not a complete URI it is resolved against the current base URI; if not defined by other means this would be the location of the current document. The above example consequently would mean, that the file `myImage.jpg` referenced from graphic resides at the same location (in the same folder) as the MEI-file. The xml:base attribute may be used “to specify a base URI other than the base URI of the document or external entity.” (Marsch, Jonathan; Tobin, Richard: XML Base (Second Edition). W3C Recommendation 28 January 2009. online at: http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/2009\/REC-xmlbase-20090128\/ ). The graphic element uses target and xml:base <graphic target=\"myImage.jpg\" xml:base=\"http:\/\/www.mySite.org\/images\/\"\/> The value of xml:base can be inherited from an ancestor. This is relevant for resolving relative links or URIs within the document. A comprehensible use case can be illustrated by the following example: the values of the graphic elements' target attribute can be completed by the xml:base value specified for the ancestor facsimile element: Value of xml:base inherits from the ancestor facsimile element <facsimile xml:base=\"http:\/\/www.mySite.org\/images\/\"> <surface> <graphic target=\"myImage.jpg\"\/> <graphic target=\"myImage.tif\"\/> <\/surface> <\/facsimile> In order to determine an absolute URI, the base URIs of the element and all its ancestors (including the document node) have to be taken into account. In the above case the relative URIs of graphic\/@target would consequently resolve to: ``` http:\/\/www.mySite.org\/images\/myImage.jpg http:\/\/www.mySite.org\/images\/myImage.tif ``` For more information on xml:base see: https:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/xmlbase\/ The xml:id and xml:base attributes are especially important when it comes to linking document fragments to each other or to external entities. Many of the linking attributes are globally available in MEI through the att.common attribute class. Yet there are other attributes from the XML-Namespace encountered in MEI files. While xml:lang attribute may be used to encode the language of an element's contents, the xml:space attribute lets you define the handling of whitespace, i.e. , whitespace being important content ( preserve ) or negligible ( default ). With the latter also being the default value if no xml:space attribute is present.","url":"content\/shared.html#sharedXmlAttributes","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1 Label Attributes","desc":" att.labelled att.nNumberLike att.nInteger","remarks":"The label and n attributes both serve a labeling function; however, they differ in the values they allow.

If absolute start point coordinates are specified using x \/ y coordinates (or their relatives x2 \/ y2 for endpoints) they take precedence over relative positions specified by ho \/ vo \/ to (or startho \/ startvo \/ startto ). Analogously, x2 \/ y2 override endho \/ endvo \/ endto . If to \/ startto \/ endto attributes are used, the start or end point is x-aligned with the indicated timestamp. If relative start coordinates ( ho \/ vo or startho \/ startvo ) are used, the origin of the coordinate system to be used for the start point is the first one found by the following search schema: If startid is present, the origin of the referenced element; If the element is inside running text ( e.g. , inside tempo ), the end of the preceding text or element; Otherwise, the origin of the containing element. The start point is offset from this origin by the value of the start coordinates ( ho \/ vo or startho \/ startvo ), using staff units. Analogously, the endpoint is determined using end coordinates ( endho \/ endvo ). If endid is specified, it takes precedence over startid . Examples of origins are: staff and layer : The horizontal origin is the starting point of the measure, the vertical one is the bottom staff line; note : The horizontal origin is the left end of the notehead, the vertical one is the center of the notehead; clef : The horizontal origin is the left end of the clef, the vertical one the line specified by clef \/ line (or clef.line ); For elements containing text: The left end of the baseline; symbolDef : As symbol definitions aren't rendered directly, their coordinate system and origin are considered virtual. When they are referenced by symbol or altsym , the origin of the context, i.e. , the referencing symbol, is used. If neither absolute nor relative coordinates are specified, determining visually suitable start and end points for line and curve attributes is left to the rendering application. A value of 0 is not always assumed for absent relative coordinates. A typical example where a rendering application may not choose the origins of absent relative start and end coordinates to be the start point as well is the line connecting two notes in the above Schumann example.","url":"content\/shared.html#usersymbolsPositioning","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1.1 Curve Shape","desc":" symbolDef","remarks":"If neither a bezier nor bulge attribute is present, the renderer determines a suitable shape. However, if curvedir is present, the curve must respect the curvature direction specified there. The attributes bezier and bulge define the shape of a curve in two different ways. If both are present, a rendering application may choose either one. They override curvedir . bezier defines the inner control points of a cubic Bézier curve, i.e. , a Bézier curve with two inner control points. The coordinates are given by a space separated list, first x and y offsets for the first control point, then x and y offsets for the second one. The x and y offsets are given in staff units (or inside the context of symbolDef in abstract units). The offsets for the first inner control point are relative to the start point, the ones for the second inner control point are relative to the end point. The bulge attribute allows specification of the curve shape by a number of interpolation points. The interpolation points are given by their distance from the line connecting the start and end point. The distance values are stored as a space separated list. The interpolation points are calculated as follows: If bulge provides n distance values, the connection line is divided into n+1 subsegments of equal length. The interpolation points are found by drawing a perpendicular line of the respective length at each subsegment joint. Positive distance values are drawn to the left of the connection line (left when traveling from start to end), negative ones to the right.

That is, 'narrow' is the default value, 'medium' is twice as wide as 'narrow', and 'wide' is twice as wide as 'medium'. In addition to textual values, the width attribute may contain a numeric value and an optional unit, e.g. , 2mm . If the unit value is not provided, MEI virtual units are presumed.

There are many different types of metadata, which MEI tries to order according to their respective scope or perspective, as described in . MEI’s approach to metadata is heavily influenced by other existing standards and models, such as TEI, MARC, and FRBR. It attempts to reflect both current library practice and common scholarly methods, for example in the field of source descriptions (see chapter ). This chapter thus addresses the description of an encoded item so that the musical text, as well as its sources, encoding, and revisions are all thoroughly documented. Such documentation is necessary for scholars using the texts, for software processing them, and for catalogers in libraries and archives. Together these descriptions and declarations provide an electronic analog to the title page attached to a printed work. They also constitute an equivalent for the content of the code books or introductory manuals customarily accompanying electronic data sets.","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerintro","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1 Structure of the MEI Header","desc":" meiHead titleStmt","remarks":"Every MEI-conformant text not embedded in another XML carrier that provides for capturing metadata, such as TEI or METS, must carry a set of descriptions, prefixed to it and encoded as described in this chapter. This set is known as the MEI header, tagged meiHead . The metadata encoded inside meiHead covers a number of different use cases. Some child elements like titleStmt may appear in various places (see ), so it is important to understand the roles of the different areas of the MEI header. These areas are described following their order of appearance within the meiHead element: Zero or more alternative identifiers , tagged with altId , each of which provides an identifying name or number associated with the file. This is just a simple element that helps to preserve other external identifiers for a file, such as database keys. A file description , tagged fileDesc , containing a full bibliographic description of the computer file itself. From the information contained here, a user of the encoding should be able to derive a proper bibliographic citation, and a librarian or archivist could use it for creating a catalog entry recording its presence within a library or archive. A titleStmt within fileDesc captures the title of the file , which may be different than the title of the encoded work , or the title given on any of the sources used to generate the file. The term computer file here is to be understood as referring to the whole intellectual entity or document described by the header, even when this is stored in multiple physical operating system files. The file description also includes information about the source or sources from which the electronic document was derived (not to be confused with sources that represent or witness the encoded work in a more general sense; these may be described within the manifestationList element). The MEI elements used to encode the file description are described in section . An optional encoding description , tagged encodingDesc , which describes the relationship between an electronic text and its source or sources. It allows for detailed description of whether (or how) the text was normalized during transcription, how the encoder resolved ambiguities in the source, what levels of encoding or analysis were applied, and similar matters. The MEI elements used to encode the encoding description are described in section . An optional work description or list of the works encoded or described in the file, tagged workList , containing classification and contextual information about the work(s), such as its subject matter, the situation in which it was produced, the individuals described by or participating in producing it, and so forth. Such a work profile is of particular use in highly structured composite texts such as corpora or language collections, where it is often highly desirable to enforce a controlled descriptive vocabulary or to perform retrievals from a body of text in terms of text type or origin. The work description may however be of use in any form of automatic text processing. The MEI elements used to encode the work description are described in section . An optional list of manifestations of the work, tagged manifestationList , containing descriptions of sources (\"manifestations\" in terms) that represent or witness the encoded work in some way, regardless of whether the encoding is based on these sources or not; for instance, it is useful for listing all known sources to a particular work in a cataloging project or a critical edition. The MEI elements used to encode the source description are described in section . Zero or more elements tagged extMeta , containing non-MEI metadata . This concept is covered in section . A revision history , tagged revisionDesc , which allows the encoder to provide a history of changes made during the development of the electronic text. The revision history is important for version control and for resolving questions about the history of a file. The MEI elements used to encode the revision description are described in section .","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerstructure","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1 Common Metadata Concepts","desc":"","remarks":"This chapter introduces data models and markup available in various locations of the MEI header.","url":"content\/metadata.html#commonconcepts","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1 Title Statement","desc":" titleStmt fileDesc manifestation title titlePage work contributor creator editor funder sponsor respStmt","remarks":"The titleStmt element is to capture the title of an MEI file (within a fileDesc element) and the title of any of the relevant manifestation s (sources) of the encoded work. The title statement contains the title given to the electronic work, together with one or more optional statements of responsibility which identify the encoder, editor, author, compiler, or other parties responsible for it: The title element contains the chief name of the electronic work. Its content takes the form considered appropriate by its creator. The element may be repeated, if the work has more than one title (perhaps in different languages). Where the electronic work is derived from an existing source text, it is strongly recommended that the title for the former should be derived from the latter, but clearly distinguishable from it, for example by the addition of a phrase such as ‘: an electronic transcription’ or ‘a digital edition’. This will distinguish the electronic work from the source text in citations and in catalogs, which contain descriptions of both types of material. Encoding of title informations <titleStmt xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.music-encoding.org\/ns\/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http:\/\/relaxng.org\/ns\/structure\/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http:\/\/purl.oclc.org\/dsdl\/schematron\"> <title>Lieder-Album für die Jugend<\/title> <title type=\"subtitle\">für Singstimme(n) und Klavier, <identifier>op. 79<\/identifier> <\/title> <title type=\"subtitle\">an electronic transcription<\/title> <\/titleStmt> Other alternative titles or subtitles may be encoded in additional title elements with values in the type attribute that distinguish them from the chief title. Sample values for the type attribute include: main (main title), subordinate (subtitle, title of part), abbreviated (abbreviated form of title), alternative (alternate title by which the work is also known), translated (translated form of title), uniform (collective title). The type attribute is provided for convenience in analyzing titles and processing them according to their type; where such specialized processing is not necessary, there is no need for such analysis, and the entire title, including subtitles and any parallel titles, may be enclosed within a single title element, as in the following example: Example of a title element <title>Symphony No. 5 in C Minor : an electronic transcription<\/title> The electronic work will also have an external name (its ‘filename’ or ‘data set name’) or reference number on the computer system where it resides at any time. This name is likely to change frequently, as new copies of the file are made on the computer system. Its form is entirely dependent on the particular computer system in use and thus cannot always easily be transferred from one system to another. Moreover, a given work may be composed of many files. For these reasons, these Guidelines strongly recommend that such names should not be used as the title for any electronic work. Helpful guidance on the formulation of useful descriptive titles in difficult cases may be found in the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (Gorman and Winkler, 1978, chapter 25) or in equivalent national-level bibliographical documentation. It is important to keep in mind that the titleStmt element provides structured metadata. Preserving the exact rendition of a title page is possible using the titlePage element (see ). The title of a work is given by using the title element directly, as many other child elements of titleStmt are available on work directly.","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerTitleStatement","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1 Responsibility Attribution","desc":" respStmt name resp persName corpName analytic bibl change edition editionStmt genState imprint monogr pubStmt series seriesStmt titleStmt","remarks":"In scholarly work, attribution of responsibility is crucial. For this purpose, MEI offers the respStmt element, which is available in the following contexts: At a minimum, the creator of the musical text and the creator of the file should be identified. If the bibliographic description is for a corpus, identify the creator of the corpus. Optionally also include the names of others involved in the transcription or elaboration of the text, sponsors, and funding agencies. The name of the person responsible for physical data input need not normally be recorded, unless that person is also intellectually responsible for some aspect of the creation of the file. In traditional bibliographic practice, those with primary creative responsibility are given special prominence. MEI accommodates this approach by providing responsibility-role elements. For example: Encoding of primary creative responsibility <titleStmt> <title>Auf dem Hügel sitz ich spähend : an electronic transcription<\/title> <composer>Ludwig van Beethoven<\/composer> <lyricist>Aloys Jeitteles<\/lyricist> <\/titleStmt> Secondary intellectual responsibility in this case is encoded using respStmt . The respStmt element has two subcomponents: a name element identifying a responsible individual or organization, and a resp element indicating the nature of the responsibility. All names should be stated in the form in which the persons or bodies wish to be publicly cited. This will usually be the fullest form of the name, including first names. No specific recommendations are made at this time as to appropriate content for resp . However, it should make clear the nature of the responsibility. Encoding of secondary intellectual responsibility <titleStmt> <title>Auf dem Hügel sitz ich spähend : an electronic transcription<\/title> <composer>Ludwig van Beethoven<\/composer> <lyricist>Aloys Jeitteles<\/lyricist> <respStmt> <resp>Encoded by<\/resp> <name>Maja Hartwig<\/name> <name>Kristina Richts<\/name> <\/respStmt> <\/titleStmt> This method of encoding facilitates exchange of bibliographic data with library catalogs and bibliographic databases as well as applications whose handling of bibliographic data is restricted to traditional responsibility roles. Additional information regarding these responsibility-role elements can be found in chapter . When the MEI.namesdates module is enabled, two additional elements are also permitted within respStmt : These elements allow for more precise identification of the entity associated with the name than is permitted by the simpler name element. The following example shows how a precise date range can be associated with a personal or corporate name. Example of respStmt <respStmt> <resp>Machine-readable transcription by:<\/resp> <persName enddate=\"1940-11-06\" startdate=\"1860-01-01\">John Doe<\/persName> <\/respStmt> For additional information about corporate and personal names, see chapter . In addition to, or instead of the resp element, the role attribute on name , persName , and corpName may be used to capture the nature of responsibility. While resp accommodates capturing the wide variety of text that may occur in responsibility statements, use of the role attribute provides the possibility of recording a controlled value independently of the textual content of resp . The role attribute captures the nature of responsibility <respStmt> <resp>Encoded by<\/resp> <corpName role=\"encoder\">Members of the Local Symphony Orchestra<\/corpName> <\/respStmt> Values from the MARC relator code list ( http:\/\/www.loc.gov\/marc\/relators\/relacode.html ) or term list ( http:\/\/www.loc.gov\/marc\/relators\/relaterm.html ) are recommended for role , where applicable. Where it is necessary to group responsibilities and names, multiple responsibility statements may be used. For example: Group responsibilities with multiple respStmt <titleStmt> <title>Symphony No. 5 in C Minor : an electronic transcription<\/title> <respStmt> <resp>Encoded by<\/resp> <persName role=\"encoder\">Joe Encoder<\/persName> <persName role=\"encoder\">Jane Decoder<\/persName> <\/respStmt> <respStmt> <resp>Images scanned by<\/resp> <persName>Ludwig van Ludwig<\/persName> <\/respStmt> <\/titleStmt> It is often desirable to mix primary and secondary intellectual responsibility information. Treating all intellectual roles the same way can allow literal transcription of existing responsibility statements and simplify programmatic processing. The following example demonstrates how a responsibility statement may be transcribed using interleaved resp and persName elements: Mix primary and secondary intellectual responsibility information <titleStmt> <title>Symphony No. 5 in C Minor : an electronic transcription<\/title> <respStmt> <resp>Composed by:<\/resp> <persName role=\"composer\">Ludwig van Beethoven<\/persName> <persName role=\"encoder\">Johannes Jones:<\/persName> <resp>Machine-readable transcription<\/resp> <\/respStmt> <\/titleStmt> However, eliminating explanatory text and relying on standardized values for role , as in the following example, allows data creation and processing tools of the greatest simplicity. Standardized values for role <titleStmt> <title>Symphony No. 5 in C Minor : an electronic transcription<\/title> <respStmt> <persName role=\"composer\">Ludwig van Beethoven<\/persName> <persName role=\"editor\">Johannes Jones<\/persName> <\/respStmt> <\/titleStmt>","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerrespstatement","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1 Associating Metadata and Data","desc":"","remarks":"In the MEI header, the data attribute may be used to associate metadata with related notational elements.

The file description element of the MEI header has therefore been closely modelled on existing standards in library cataloging; it should thus provide enough information to allow users to give standard bibliographic references to the electronic text, and to allow catalogers to catalog it. Bibliographic citations occurring elsewhere in the header, and in the text itself, are derived from the same model. The bibliographic description of an electronic musical text should be supplied by the mandatory fileDesc element: The fileDesc element contains two mandatory and six optional elements, each of which is described in more detail below. These elements are listed below in the order in which they must occur within the fileDesc element. A complete file description will resemble the following example: Structure of a complete file description <fileDesc> <titleStmt> <!-- title of the resource --> <\/titleStmt> <editionStmt> <!-- information about the edition of the resource --> <\/editionStmt> <extent> <!-- description of the size of the resource --> <\/extent> <pubStmt> <!-- information about the publication and distribution of the resource --> <\/pubStmt> <seriesStmt> <!-- information about any series to which the resource belongs --> <\/seriesStmt> <notesStmt> <!-- notes on other aspects of the resource --> <\/notesStmt> <sourceDesc> <!-- information about the source(s) from which the resource was derived --> <\/sourceDesc> <\/fileDesc>","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerFileDescription","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1.1 Edition Statement","desc":" editionStmt fileDesc titleStmt date respStmt edition","remarks":"The editionStmt element is the second component of the fileDesc element, following the mandatory titleStmt . It is optional but recommended when applicable. It contains elements for identifying the edition and those responsible for it: For printed texts, the term ‘edition’ applies to the set of all the identical copies of an item produced from one master copy and issued by a particular publishing agency or a group of such agencies. A change in the identity of the distributing body or bodies does not normally constitute a change of edition, while a change in the master copy does. For electronic texts, the notion of a master copy is not entirely appropriate, since they are far more easily copied and modified than printed ones; nonetheless, the term edition may be used for a particular state of a machine-readable text at which substantive changes are made and fixed. Synonymous terms used in these Guidelines are version, level, and release. The words revision and update, by contrast, are used for minor changes to a file which do not amount to a new edition. No simple rule can specify how substantive changes have to be before they are regarded as producing a new edition, rather than a simple update. The general principle proposed here is that the production of a new edition entails a significant change in the intellectual content of the file, rather than its encoding or appearance. The addition of analytic coding to a text would thus constitute a new edition, while automatic conversion from one coded representation to another would not. Changes relating to the character code or physical storage details, corrections of misspellings, simple changes in the arrangement of the contents and changes in the output format do not normally constitute a new edition, whereas the addition of new information ( e.g. , annotations, sound or images, links to external data) almost always does. Clearly, there will always be borderline cases and the matter is somewhat arbitrary. The simplest rule is: if you think that your file is a new edition, then call it such. An edition statement is optional for the first release of a computer file; it is mandatory for each later release, though this requirement cannot be enforced. Note that all changes in a file, whether or not they are regarded as constituting a new edition or simply a revision, should be independently noted in the revision description section of the file header (see section ). The edition element should contain phrases describing the edition or version, including the word 'edition', 'version', or an equivalent term, together with a number or date, or terms indicating difference from other editions such as 'new edition', 'revised edition', etc. Any dates that occur within the edition statement should be marked with the date element. The n attribute of the edition element may be used as elsewhere to supply any formal identification (such as a version number) for the edition. One or more respStmt elements may also be used to supply statements of responsibility for the edition in question. These may refer to individuals or corporate bodies and can indicate functions such as that of a reviser, or can name the person or body responsible for the provision of supplementary matter, of appendices, etc., in a new edition. Some examples follow: Example of editionStmt <editionStmt> <edition n=\"Draft2\">Second draft, substantially extended, revised, and corrected.<\/edition> <\/editionStmt> respStmt within editionStmt <editionStmt> <edition>Student's edition, <date>June 1987<\/date> <\/edition> <respStmt> <resp>New annotations by<\/resp> <name>George Brown<\/name> <\/respStmt> <\/editionStmt>","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerEditionstmt","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1.1 Extent of the File","desc":" fileDesc extent","remarks":"The third component of the fileDesc is a description of the physical qualities of the file. The extent element is provided for this purpose. The extent element describes the approximate size of a text as stored on some carrier medium, whether digital or non-digital, specified in any convenient units. For printed books, information about the carrier, such as the kind of medium used and its size, are of great importance in cataloging procedures. The print-oriented rules for bibliographic description of an item’s medium and extent need some re-interpretation when applied to electronic media. An electronic file exists as a distinct entity quite independently of its carrier and remains the same intellectual object whether it is stored as file on a hard disc drive, a CD-ROM, a set of USB devices, or in the internet. Since, moreover, these Guidelines are specifically aimed at facilitating transparent document storage and interchange, any purely machine-dependent information should be irrelevant as far as the file header is concerned. This is particularly true of information about file-type although library-oriented rules for cataloging often distinguish two types of computer file: ‘data’ and ‘programs’. This distinction is quite difficult to draw in some cases, for example, hypermedia or texts with built-in search and retrieval software. Although it is equally system-dependent, some measure of the size of the computer file may be of use for cataloging and other practical purposes. Because the measurement and expression of file size is fraught with difficulties, only very general recommendations are possible; the element extent should contain a phrase indicating the size or approximate size of the computer file in one of the following ways: in bytes of a specified length ( e.g. , ‘4000 bytes’) as falling within a range of values, for example: less than 1 Mb between 1 Mb and 5 Mb between 6 Mb and 10 Mb over 10 Mb in terms of any convenient logical units (for example, words or sentences, citations, paragraphs) in terms of any convenient physical units (for example, compact discs, removable hard drives, DVDs) The use of standard abbreviations for units of quantity is recommended where applicable, here as elsewhere (see http:\/\/physics.nist.gov\/cuu\/Units\/binary.html ). Example of extent <extent>between 1 MB and 2 MB<\/extent> <!-- or --> <extent>4.2 MiB<\/extent> <!-- or --> <extent>4532 Mbytes<\/extent> <!-- or --> <extent>3200 sentences<\/extent> <!-- or --> <extent>5 90-mm high density diskettes<\/extent> For ease of processability, the use of the unit attribute is recommended whenever possible, as in the following example: extent uses the unit attribute to ease the processability <extent unit=\"byte\">65535<\/extent> The unit attribute is restricted to certain values: byte (Byte), char (Character), cm (Centimeter), deg (Degree), in (Inch), issue (Serial issue), ft (Foot), m (Meter), mm (Millimeter), page (Page), pc (Pica), pt (Point), px (Pixel), rad (Radian), record (Record), vol (Serial volume), and vu (MEI virtual unit). A virtual unit (vu) in MEI is a measure of distance. It is determined by half the distance between adjacent staff lines where the interline space is measured from the middle of a staff line. Unless otherwise specified, the MEI virtual unit is set as the default unit.","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerFileExtent","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1.1 Publication, Distribution, etc.","desc":" pubStmt fileDesc unpub respStmt availability publisher distributor address date identifier pubPlace accessRestrict price sysReq useRestrict","remarks":"The pubStmt element is the fourth component of the fileDesc element and is mandatory.

Nevertheless, the notesStmt element may be used to record potentially significant details about the file and its features, for example: dates, when they are relevant to the content or condition of the computer file: e.g. , ‘manual dated 2010’, ‘file validated Apr 2011’ names of persons or bodies connected with the technical production, administration, or consulting functions of the effort which produced the file, if these are not named in statements of responsibility in the title or edition statements of the file description: e.g. , ‘Historical commentary provided by members of the Big Symphony Orchestra’ availability of the file in an additional medium or information not already recorded about the availability of documentation: e.g. , ‘User manual is loose-leaf in eleven paginated sections’ language of work and abstract, if not encoded in the langUsage element, e.g. , ‘Text in English with stage directions in French and German’ Each such item of information may be tagged using the general-purpose annot element. Groups of annotations are contained within the notesStmt element, as in the following example: Groups of annotations are contained within the notesStmt element <notesStmt> <annot>Historical commentary provided by John Smith.<\/annot> <annot>OCR scanning performed at University of Virginia.<\/annot> <\/notesStmt> There are advantages, however, to encoding such information with more precise elements elsewhere in the MEI header, when such elements are available. For example, the notes above might be encoded as follows: Notes encoded with more precise elements <titleStmt> <title>…<\/title> <respStmt> <persName>John Smith<\/persName> <resp>historical commentary<\/resp> <\/respStmt> <respStmt> <corpName>University of Virginia<\/corpName> <resp>OCR scanning<\/resp> <\/respStmt> <\/titleStmt>","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerNotesStatement","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1.1 Source Description","desc":" sourceDesc fileDesc source head locusGrp locus bibl biblStruct","remarks":"The sourceDesc element is the seventh and final component of the fileDesc element.

Each application element identifies the current state of one software application with regard to the current file. This element is a member of the att.datable class, which provides a variety of attributes for associating this state with a date and time, or a temporal range. The xml:id and version attributes should be used to uniquely identify the application and its major version number (for example, 'Music Markup Tool 1.5'). It is not intended that a software application should add a new application element each time it touches the file. The following example shows how these elements might be used to record the fact that version 1.5 of an application called ‘Music Markup Tool’ has an interest in two parts of a document.

Some of these policy elements carry attributes to support automated processing of certain well-defined editorial decisions; all of them contain a prose description of the editorial principles adopted with respect to the particular feature concerned. Examples of the kinds of questions which these descriptions are intended to answer are given in the list below. correction States how and under what circumstances corrections have been made in the text. corrlevel indicates the degree of correction applied to the text. method indicates the method employed to mark corrections and normalizations. Was the text corrected during or after data capture? If so, were corrections made silently or are they marked using the tags described in chapter ? What principles have been adopted with respect to omissions, truncations, dubious corrections, alternate readings, false starts, repetitions, etc.? interpretation Describes the scope of any analytic or interpretive information added to the transcription of the music. Has any analytic or ‘interpretive’ information been provided — that is, information which is felt to be non-obvious, or potentially contentious? If so, how was it generated? How was it encoded? normalization Indicates the extent of normalization or regularization of the original source carried out in converting it to electronic form. method indicates the method employed to mark corrections and normalizations. Was the text normalized, for example by regularizing any non-standard enharmonic spellings, etc.? If so, were normalizations performed silently or are they marked using the tags described in chapter ? What authority was used for the regularization? Also, what principles were used when normalizing numbers to provide the standard values for the value attribute described in sections – and what format is used for them? segmentation Describes the principles according to which the musical text has been segmented, for example into movements, sections, etc. How is the musical text segmented? If mdiv and\/or section elements have been used to partition the music for analysis, how are they marked and how was the segmentation arrived at? stdVals (standard values) Specifies the format used when standardized date or number values are supplied. In most cases, attributes bearing standardized values should conform to a defined datatype. In cases where this is not appropriate, this element may be used to describe the standardization methods underlying the values supplied. Experience shows that a full record should be kept of decisions relating to editorial principles and encoding practice, both for future users of the text and for the project which produced the text in the first instance.

Its use is optional but highly recommended. It provides essential information for the administration of large numbers of files which are being updated, corrected, or otherwise modified as well as extremely useful documentation for files being passed from researcher to researcher or system to system. Without change logs, it is easy to confuse different versions of a file, or to remain unaware of small but important changes made in the file by some earlier link in the chain of distribution. No change should be made in any MEI-conformant file without corresponding entries being made in the change log. The main purpose of the revision description is to record changes in the text to which a header is prefixed. However, it is recommended practice to include entries also for significant changes in the header itself (other than the revision description itself, of course). At the very least, an entry should be supplied indicating the date of creation of the header. The log consists of a list of change elements, each of which contains a detailed description of the changes made. If a number is to be associated with one or more changes (for example, a revision number), the n attribute may be used to indicate it. The person responsible for the change and the date of the change may be indicated by the respStmt and date elements. The description of the change itself is contained within the changeDesc element, which can hold one or more paragraphs. It is recommended to give changes in reverse chronological order, most recent first. For example: Example of revisionDesc <revisionDesc> <change n=\"4\"> <respStmt> <persName>KR<\/persName> <\/respStmt> <changeDesc> <p>Cleaned up MEI file automatically using Header.xsl.<\/p> <\/changeDesc> <date isodate=\"2011-12-01\"\/> <\/change> <change n=\"3\"> <respStmt> <persName>KR<\/persName> <\/respStmt> <changeDesc> <p>Cleaned up MEI file automatically using ppq.xsl.<\/p> <\/changeDesc> <date isodate=\"2011-10-21\"\/> <\/change> <\/revisionDesc> A slightly shorter form for recording changes is also available when the date of the change can be described by a single date in a standard ISO form and when the name of the agent(s) responsible for the change, encoded elsewhere in the header, can be referred to by one or more URIs given in the resp attribute. For example: Shorter form for recording changes <change isodate=\"2011-10-21\" n=\"3\" resp=\"#KR #MH\"> <changeDesc> <p>Cleaned up MEI file automatically using ppq.xsl.<\/p> <\/changeDesc> <\/change>","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerRevisionDescription","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1 Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)","desc":"","remarks":"MEI header information may refer to different levels of description of the encoded work: Some information may apply the work in all its various forms and realizations, e.g. , the name of its composer. Other information may describe a certain version of the work, or a source such as the printed first edition, or only a single copy of that source. Core MEI limits the header information to two such levels of description: work and source, respectively. However, when the FRBR module is available more detailed descriptions are possible. With certain limitations, mainly due to the musical nature of the works encoded in MEI, the FRBR module adapts the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) as recommended by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). The IFLA’s FRBR model distinguishes four levels of abstraction, or entities: Work FRBR defines a work as a distinct intellectual or artistic creation , an abstract entity because there is no single material object one can point to as the work. Expression An expression is defined as the intellectual or artistic realization of a work in the form of [...] notation, sound, image, object, movement, etc., or any combination of such forms . Expressions are also abstract entities. Manifestation A manifestation is defined as the physical embodiment of an expression of a work , including, for instance, manuscripts, books, sound recordings, films, video recordings, CD-ROMs, multimedia kits, etc. The manifestation represents all the physical objects that bear the same characteristics, with respect to both intellectual content and physical form. Item A single exemplar of a manifestation is called an item, e.g. , a specific copy of a printed score. With manuscripts, item and manifestation levels are nearly identical. A manuscript may be regarded as a manifestation having only one item.","url":"content\/metadata.html#FRBR","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1 FRBR Entities in MEI","desc":" work expression manifestation item source sourceDesc expressionList audience perfMedium manifestationList itemList extent scoreFormat","remarks":"With the FRBR module, MEI offers four elements corresponding to the FRBR \"Group 1\" entities: The names of the MEI entities follow those of FRBR: the work element is a container for description at the FRBR \"work\" level, expression is for description at the FRBR \"expression\" level, manifestation contains \"manifestation\" level description, and item holds FRBR \"item\" level description. Please note: Until MEI 3.0.0, the source element in sourceDesc was used for manifestation-level descriptions. The work element has an optional child element to hold the expression elements: As expressionList is a container element for descriptions of different expressions of the same work, it may contain only expression elements. The content model of expression is similar to that of work . It does not, however, permit expressionList and audience elements. But it adds elements that aid identification and description of specific versions of a work: Since expressions, like works, are abstractions, their titles are often nebulous. Usually, however, the title of an expression is the same as the work it represents. When the relationship between a work and an expression is encoded hierarchically, the expression’s title element may be omitted with the assumption that it will be inherited from the work. If no title is provided for an expression, distinguishing characteristics must be provided in other elements, such as perfMedium , as in the following example: <work xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.music-encoding.org\/ns\/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http:\/\/relaxng.org\/ns\/structure\/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http:\/\/purl.oclc.org\/dsdl\/schematron\"> <title>Pavane pour une infante défunte<\/title> <expressionList> <expression> <title\/> <perfMedium> <perfResList> <perfRes>piano<\/perfRes> <\/perfResList> <\/perfMedium> <\/expression> <expression> <title\/> <perfMedium> <perfResList> <perfRes>orchestra<\/perfRes> <\/perfResList> <\/perfMedium> <\/expression> <\/expressionList> <\/work> Programmatic concatenation of the work title and one or more characteristics of the expression can be used to provide identification for the expression. For example, the expressions above may be identified by \"Pavane pour une infante défunte (piano)\" and \"Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestra)\". In some cases, it may be helpful to assign a descriptive title to the expression, as illustrated below. The carrier of the manifestation is often a good source of this kind of descriptive text. <work xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.music-encoding.org\/ns\/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http:\/\/relaxng.org\/ns\/structure\/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http:\/\/purl.oclc.org\/dsdl\/schematron\"> <title>Pavane pour une infante défunte<\/title> <expressionList> <expression> <title>Version for piano<\/title> <perfMedium> <perfResList> <perfRes>piano<\/perfRes> <\/perfResList> <\/perfMedium> <\/expression> <expression> <title>Version for orchestra<\/title> <perfMedium> <perfResList> <perfRes>orchestra<\/perfRes> <\/perfResList> <\/perfMedium> <\/expression> <\/expressionList> <\/work> <work xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.music-encoding.org\/ns\/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http:\/\/relaxng.org\/ns\/structure\/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http:\/\/purl.oclc.org\/dsdl\/schematron\"> <title>Sonata No. 2<\/title> <expressionList> <expression> <title>Live recording at Carnegie Hall<\/title> <\/expression> <expression> <title>Studio recording<\/title> <\/expression> <\/expressionList> <\/work> The manifestationList and manifestation elements are discussed in section . The itemList element provides functionality similar to that of expressionList ; that is, it can be used to group descriptions of individual items (exemplars) of the parent source.

All four entities utilize the same element: However, the child elements of a component group must be the same type as the group’s parent. This allows for a more detailed description than is possible using the core MEI contents element. For example, a work element’s componentList element can only contain work elements, etc. In this way, the componentList element may be employed to describe composite works, as in the example below: <work xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.music-encoding.org\/ns\/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http:\/\/relaxng.org\/ns\/structure\/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http:\/\/purl.oclc.org\/dsdl\/schematron\"> <title>Der Ring des Nibelungen<\/title> <componentList> <work> <title>Das Rheingold<\/title> <\/work> <work> <title>Die Walküre<\/title> <\/work> <work> <title>Siegfried<\/title> <\/work> <work> <title>Götterdämmerung<\/title> <\/work> <\/componentList> <\/work> This technique can also be applied when a single intellectual source is comprised of multiple physical parts.

MEI provides the following elements for this purpose. Each of the four FRBR entity equivalents – the work, expression, source, and item elements – allows a list of such relationship descriptions as its last child element. relationList provides a container for individual relation elements. The nature of the relationship must be specified by the rel attribute and the target of the relationship must be identified by the target attribute. The values allowed by rel follow those defined for FRBR at http:\/\/www.ifla.org\/files\/assets\/cataloguing\/frbr\/frbr_2008.pdf . Since relations are bidirectional, they may be defined on both entities involved, using pairs of oppositely-directed relation descriptors. The following FRBR relations are allowed in MEI as values of the relation element’s rel attribute (shown in pairs for clarity): hasAbridgement \/ isAbridgementOf hasAdaptation \/ isAdaptationOf hasAlternate \/ isAlternateOf hasArrangement \/ isArrangementOf hasComplement \/ isComplementOf hasEmbodiment \/ isEmbodimentOf hasExemplar \/ isExemplarOf hasImitation \/ isImitationOf hasPart \/ isPartOf hasRealization \/ isRealizationOf hasReconfiguration \/ isReconfigurationOf hasReproduction \/ isReproductionOf hasRevision \/ isRevisionOf hasSuccessor \/ isSuccessorOf hasSummarization \/ isSummarizationOf hasSupplement \/ isSupplementOf hasTransformation \/ isTransformationOf hasTranslation \/ isTranslationOf Some of these relationships are already implicitly expressed by the MEI structural model: FRBR defines an expression entity as a realization of a work, but as this relation is implied by the expressionList element’s child relationship to its parent work element, the hasRealization\/isRealizationOf relation does not need to be explicitly declared. Likewise, it is not necessary to specify by means of relation elements that an item is an exemplar of the source described by its parent source element. This resembles the FRBR model, which allows 1:n relationships both between works and expressions, and between manifestations and items. However, as FRBR allows n:n relations between expressions and manifestations (in MEI: sources), a hierarchical model based on the structure of XML is clearly insufficient to express all possible expression \/ manifestation combinations. It is therefore required to declare these relations explicitly. In FRBR terms, a manifestation \/ source is an embodiment of an expression. A manifestation is an embodiment of an expression <manifestation xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.music-encoding.org\/ns\/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http:\/\/relaxng.org\/ns\/structure\/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http:\/\/purl.oclc.org\/dsdl\/schematron\"> <titleStmt> <title>Score, first edition<\/title> <\/titleStmt> <relationList> <relation rel=\"isEmbodimentOf\" target=\"#version_for_orchestra\"\/> <\/relationList> <\/manifestation> Within the componentList element, the order of child elements implicitly describes a hasSuccessor\/isSuccessorOf relationship between components, i.e. , it defines a certain sequence such as the movements of a work. In other cases, relation elements may be needed to explicitly encode relationships not otherwise defined by encoding order or hierarchy. For instance, the hasReproduction\/isReproductionOf relationship may be used to indicate that one source is a reprint of another. A manifestation is a reproduction in form of a reprint of another source <manifestation xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.music-encoding.org\/ns\/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http:\/\/relaxng.org\/ns\/structure\/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http:\/\/purl.oclc.org\/dsdl\/schematron\"> <pubStmt> <publisher>Horneman &amp; Erslev<\/publisher> <pubPlace>Copenhagen<\/pubPlace> <date isodate=\"1874\">1874<\/date> <\/pubStmt> <relationList> <relation rel=\"isReproductionOf\" target=\"#source.printed_choral_parts\"\/> <\/relationList> <\/manifestation> Moreover, the use of componentList implicitly defines a hasPart\/isPartOf relationship between the componentList element’s parent and its child elements. Using the relationList and relation elements to define their relationship, the four component works in the \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" example above could alternatively be encoded as sibling work elements to the \"Ring\" work element. Four component works encoded as sibling work elements <workList xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.music-encoding.org\/ns\/mei\" xmlns:rng=\"http:\/\/relaxng.org\/ns\/structure\/1.0\" xmlns:sch=\"http:\/\/purl.oclc.org\/dsdl\/schematron\"> <work xml:id=\"theRing\"> <title>Der Ring des Nibelungen<\/title> <relationList> <relation rel=\"hasPart\" target=\"#rheingold\"\/> <relation rel=\"hasPart\" target=\"#walkuere\"\/> <relation rel=\"hasPart\" target=\"#siegfried\"\/> <relation rel=\"hasPart\" target=\"#goetterdaemmerung\"\/> <\/relationList> <\/work> <work xml:id=\"rheingold\"> <title>Das Rheingold<\/title> <relationList> <relation rel=\"isPartOf\" target=\"#theRing\"\/> <\/relationList> <\/work> <work xml:id=\"walkuere\"> <title>Die Walküre<\/title> <relationList> <relation rel=\"isPartOf\" target=\"#theRing\"\/> <\/relationList> <\/work> <work xml:id=\"siegfried\"> <title>Siegfried<\/title> <relationList> <relation rel=\"isPartOf\" target=\"#theRing\"\/> <\/relationList> <\/work> <work xml:id=\"goetterdaemmerung\"> <title>Götterdämmerung<\/title> <relationList> <relation rel=\"isPartOf\" target=\"#theRing\"\/> <\/relationList> <\/work> <\/workList> Relations may also be used to point to external resources.

It may be used to provide cross-references between information encoded in different places of the header. However, relatedItem is less ideal for describing the relations between works, differing versions of these works, the sources in which those versions are transmitted, and where applicable the individual copies of a print. For these situations, it is strongly recommended to use the instead. This module is based on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, as specified by the IFLA .

They appear in catalogs of music and in tables of contents of printed music that include multiple works. The following elements are provided for the inclusion of incipits: The elements incipCode and incipText are available for the inclusion of coded incipits of music notation and textual incipits, respectively. The incipText element should contain only the initial performed text of the work, while incipCode may contain both words and music, depending on the capabilities of the scheme used to encode it. When both music and text are provided in incipCode , it may be helpful to repeat the text in incipText in order to provide easier access to only the text, for example, for indexing of the text without having to extract it from the coded incipit. Both incipCode and incipText allow reference to an external file location via the target attribute and specification of the internet media type of the external file via the mimetype attribute. An MEI-encoded incipit may be captured in a score sub-element. In addition, graphic may be used as a sub-element of incip to include an image of an incipit. To facilitate the capture of metadata associated with an incipit, MEI allows the following sub-elements within incip . The order of their presentation below follows the order in which they must appear in this context. Usually, the metadata captured in this manner is rendered alongside or in lieu of a coded or graphical incipit. It may or may not serve in a work identification capacity, depending on whether the incipit is intended to represent the entire work or a segment of the work. For example, if an incipit is provided for each aria in an opera, then the metadata pertains only to the aria, not the entire work.","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerWorkIncipit","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1 Key, Tempo, and Meter","desc":" key keySig meter tempo mensuration","remarks":"The attributes key, tempo, and meter are often helpful for identifying a musical work when it does not have a distinctive title. The key element is used exclusively within bibliographic descriptions. Do not confuse this element with keySig , which is used within the body of an MEI file to record this data for musical notation. Likewise, meter should not be confused with the attributes used by staffDef and scoreDef to record meter-related data for notated music. The tempo element can be used here as well as in the body of an MEI document; however, its attributes other than xml:id , label , n , base , and lang are meaningless in the MEI header context, and therefore should be avoided within a work description. The mensuration element is available for the description of works in the mensural repertoire.

Its content is limited to text and the date and geogName elements. The history element is a container for additional non-bibliographic details relating to a work. It may use the eventList element to provide a list of key events in the creation and performance history of the work. The eventList element is comprised of event elements containing a brief description of the associated event, including dates and locations where the event took place. An event list may use the type attribute to distinguish between multiple event lists with different functions, such as a list of events in the compositional process and a list of performance dates. Event lists and other text components, such as paragraphs, tables, lists, and text divisions ( div ) may be interleaved when an 'essay-like' work history is desired. The event element permits either a text-centric or a data-centric model. The text-centric model is provided for prose descriptions, while the data-centric model accommodates event descriptions that consist of a collection of descriptive phrases. In the text-centric model, paragraphs, tables, and lists may be used. In the data-centric model, however, only certain phrase-level elements, may appear.","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerWorkHistory","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1 Language Usage","desc":" langUsage workList language","remarks":"The langUsage element is used within the workList element to describe the languages, sublanguages, dialects, etc. represented within a work. It contains one or more language elements, each of which provides information about a single language. A language element may be supplied for each different language used in a document. If used, its xml:id attribute should specify an appropriate language identifier. This is particularly important if extended language identifiers have been used as the value of xml:lang attributes elsewhere in the document. Here is an example of the use of this element: Example of langUsage <langUsage> <language xml:id=\"fr-CA\">Québecois<\/language> <language xml:id=\"en-CA\">Canadian English<\/language> <language xml:id=\"en-GB\">British English<\/language> <\/langUsage> <!-- Later in the document --> <verse n=\"1\" xml:lang=\"fr-CA\"><\/verse> <verse n=\"2\" xml:lang=\"en-CA\"><\/verse> <verse n=\"3\" xml:lang=\"en-GB\"><\/verse>","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerWorkLanguage","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1 Performance Medium","desc":" perfMedium castList perfResList","remarks":"The following elements are available for description of a composition’s performing forces: The perfMedium element provides the possibility of describing a work in terms of its medium of performance; that is, the performing forces required.

Mrs Rutter’). Cast lists often function as identifying metadata and for this reason are permitted within the description of a work. Because the format and internal structure of cast lists are unpredictable, a castList may contain any combination of castItem and castGrp elements. A castItem element may contain any mixture of text and the following elements: In the following example, role provides the name of the dramatic character and roleDesc contains a brief description of the role.

The detail provided, and the structure of these descriptions, depend on your own encoding guidelines. A colophon is an inscription at the end of a text, similar to the modern practice of providing an imprint at the beginning of a book.

Example of extent <physDesc> <extent>4 pages<\/extent> <!-- or more machine readable --> <extent unit=\"page\" quantity=\"4\"\/> <\/physDesc> The dimensions contain information about the physical size of a source.

Within watermarkList , the watermark element is used to hold information for each resource being described. The watermarkList is also optional. If information on only one watermark is goint to be recorded the element can be used in watermarkDesc without watermarkList . The element watermark can be used to describe watermarks or similar devices of filigranology. It is important to distinguish whether the watermark to be described consists of only one sign or is composed of main and countermarks. The completeness of the watermark, its positioning on the page, and the time period of the paper's production and use also play a role. It is recommended to use at least the elements title , date , annot and locus in the description: Example of watermark <watermark> <title>Welhartiz<\/title> <date label=\"usage\" startdate=\"1815\" enddate=\"1816\">1815–1816<\/date> <annot>Wappenschild mit Schrägbalken, darüber Lilie, darunter Beizeichen IAA (J sieht aus wie I!), Gegenmarke Schriftzug: „WELHARTIZ”.<\/annot> <locus>[position on the page, where you found the watermark]<\/locus> <\/watermark> For a more detailed description or encoding of a watermark, fig can be used, which on the one hand allows reference to an existing image ( graphic ) of the watermark, and on the other increases the depth of the description. To mark up different components of a watermark, several heraldry elements can be used in a figDesc and related to each other by means of relation . The fig element increases the depth of the description of the different components <fig> <graphic mimetype=\"images\/jpeg\" target=\"..\/\"\/> <figDesc> <heraldry type=\"main\" xml:id=\"watermark_ID_01-01\"> <annot> <p>Wappenschild mit Schrägbalken, darüber Lilie, darunter Beizeichen IAA (J sieht aus wie I!)<\/p> <\/annot> <relation rel=\"hasCountermark\" target=\"#watermark_ID_01-02\"\/> <\/heraldry> <heraldry type=\"countermark\" xml:id=\"watermark_ID_01-02\"> <annot> <p>Gegenmarke Schriftzug: „WELHARTIZ”<\/p> <\/annot> <relation rel=\"isCountermarkOf\" target=\"#watermark_ID_01-01\"\/> <\/heraldry> <\/figDesc> <\/fig> To ensure that the description of the pictorial signs conforms to international standards and that the individual components of the watermark are correctly represented, the multilingual description catalogue of the Bernstein project or the IPH standard should be consulted. To refer to already existing databases with watermarks, see . Stamps can appear in many forms in manuscripts and prints, for example as library stamps, library signatures, postmarks, ownership marks, address stamps or legal notices. The description of the stamp therefore depends on individual, project-specific requirements. However, it is helpful to first consider whether it is sufficient to merely name the occurring stamps, or wether it is also desirable to detail their form and textual elements, or even refer to a graphic that shows a facsimile of the stamp. Example of stamp <stamp>* The * Library * of * Congress *<\/stamp> or <stamp> SUPPL. <heraldry>[Austrian coat of arms with double-headed eagle]<\/heraldry> MUS. <lb\/><identifier label=\"shelfmark\">No. 3177<\/identifier> ❋ <\/stamp> or <stamp> <ptr target=\"..\/berlin_SPKB_stamp.jpg\"\/> <\/stamp> In any case, for a better structuring of the information as well as for better machine readability, it is recommended to identify within the description of the stamp the implicitly or explicitly mentioned persons or institutions by means of persName or corpName and to describe by locus where the stamp is positioned on the page. Example of stamp with corpName and locus <stamp> <locus>Fol. 1, 2, 3 each recto in lower left corner.<\/locus> <corpName auth=\"GND\" auth.uri=\"https:\/\/d-nb.info\/gnd\/\" codedval=\"35626-8\">Library of Congress<\/corpName> <ptr target=\"..\/loc_stamp.jpg\"\/> <\/stamp> A higher level of distinction is also recommended for address stamps: Encoding of an address stamp <stamp> <address> <addrLine><persName>Arnold Schönberg<\/persName><\/addrLine> <addrLine><geogName>Wien<\/geogName><\/addrLine> <addrLine><street>IX. Liechtensteinstraße 68\/70<\/street><\/addrLine> <\/address> <\/stamp> The scoreFormat element is a form of classification. This element is part of physDesc because within the MARC21 standard, the format of the music (score, piano score, etc.) is defined as a physical property.

Typically this uses these elements: The nesting of bifolium and folium elements reflects the nesting of paper sheets that make up the text block of the source. For instance, if a manuscript consists of two folded sheets of paper, with a single, unfolded sheet in the middle, this would be encoded with two nested bifolium elements, where the inner one has an additional folium element: Structure of foliaDesc <foliaDesc> <bifolium><!-- outer sheet --> <bifolium><!-- inner sheet --> <folium\/> <!-- single leaf in the middle --> <\/bifolium> <\/bifolium> <\/foliaDesc> Nesting of two bifolia and one folium Multiple signatures (groups of nested pages, also known as \"gatherings\" or \"quires\") bound together can be reflected by encoding a sequence of bifolium elements (with their respective contents).

In contrast, folium and bifolium may provide the dimensions of the original source in physical units, such as centimetres or inches. This makes it possible to combine separate parts of a manuscripts stored in different libraries, which are scanned at different resolutions. In case of bifolium elements, these dimensions apply to the folded sheet. Some printed scholarly editions like the Neue Bach-Ausgabe provide very detailed information about the sizes and binding of individual leaves of a manuscript.

A patch is an additional writing surface attached to one of the sides of a folium or bifolium : The patch element is placed inside the folium or bifolium to which it is attached. To which side of this parent it is attached is specified using the (required) attached.to attribute: Depending on the parent, allowed values for attached.to are either recto and verso (in case of folium ) or outer.recto , inner.verso , inner.recto and outer.verso (in case of bifolium ). The exact position of the patch on the underlying surface may be specified using the optional x and y attributes, which are used to specify the distance from the upper left corner of the patch from the upper left corner of the surface it is attached to. At this point, it is not possible to specify rotation. The (optional) attached.by attribute specifies by which means the patch is attached. Suggested values are: glue (patch is glued on surface beneath), thread (patch is sewn on surface beneath), needle (patch is pinned to the surface beneath), tape (patch is taped on surface beneath using an adhesive strip) and staple (patch is attached on surface beneath using a staple), but other values may be used as necessary. While the patch element provides information about the attachment of a patch, the actual patch is encoded as a folium or bifolium child of patch .

If, in contrast, only the lower right quarter of the page has been cut, these attributes still indicate the size of the full page (assuming that the removed section was a regular rectangle).The dimensions ( width , heigh ) on cutout itself are only to be used when there is a \"gap\" in the manuscript that allows to specify the dimensions of that missing part. In this case, the bounding box dimensions are given, together with x and y to indicate the upper left point on the original page. If, however, the removed section is available by itself, then a corresponding folium (or bifolium ) should be placed inside the cutout element, and should provide it's own dimensions using width and height there.

In comparison, provenance deals with the history of ownership or custodianship of an item. Both elements allow for the choice of either text or more structured information when formulating the specific encoding. It is recommended to make use of p elements when a text-centred encoding is favored and to use the eventList element for a more structured encoding. It is up to the encoder to decide where the information is most appropriate for the particular project or encoding purposes. The exhibHist element contains descriptions of one or more public exhibitions of a bibliographic item. Often exhibitions include an additional description in the form of a tag for the public that accompanies the item on display. These descriptions may even be printed in a published exhibition catalogue, so the encoding may also include information about why the object was shown or what was significant about the exhibition. When formulating the encoding, it is at the discretion of the encoder whether to opt for text or more structured information. Text-centred encoding is made possible by p elements in exhibHist , among others. For more structured encodings, it is recommended to use the eventList element contained in exhibHist . In FRBR-based cataloging (see ), exhibHist is conceptually bound to the item-level. As an element it is not permitted at the work or expression level and only permitted at the manifestation level if the manifestation is a manifestation singleton. The physLoc element encodes information related to, or associated with, the physical location of a bibliographic item. This includes, but is not limited to, the name of the holding institution, name or number of the building or room, or any shelfmarks, used for the purpose of retrieval. The level of detail or machine readability of the encoding is generally at the discretion of the encoder and may vary depending on the information available. The physLoc element may contain the following MEI elements: The repository element contains a description of the institution or individual currently holding the bibliographic item. Its content is either prose or structured markup. The history element, on the other hand, is a container for additional non-bibliographic details regarding the physical location of an item. It may contain the elements acquisition , exhibHist or provenance , among others, to describe any events that coincided with a change of location, such as exhibitions, or change of custody. The following example demonstrates how to structure detailed information about a repository (including the use of identifier ): Example of repository <physLoc> <repository auth=\"ISIL\" auth.uri=\"http:\/\/ld.zdb-services.de\/resource\/organisations\/\" codedval=\"DE-1\"> <identifier auth=\"RISM\">D-B<\/identifier> <corpName xml:id=\"SBB-PK\" role=\"holding institution\"> <name type=\"organization\">Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Preußischer Kulturbesitz<\/name> <name type=\"organization-site\">Haus Unter den Linden<\/name> <name type=\"department\">Musikabteilung<\/name> <\/corpName> <address> <addrLine>Unter den Linden 8<\/addrLine> <addrLine> <postCode>10117<\/postCode> <geogName auth=\"geonames\" auth.uri=\"http:\/\/www.geonames.org\/\" codedval=\"2950159\">Berlin<\/geogName> <\/addrLine> <\/address> <\/repository> <identifier type=\"shelfmark\">Mus.ms. Bach P 175<\/identifier> <\/physLoc> Conservation activities are often necessary to ensure the long-term preservation and integrity of manuscripts or printed sources. These conservation activities might include interventions such as re-binding, restoration, or modifying paper chemistry. In MEI the treatHist element records any treatment history an item has undergone, and may even specify details of the individual treatment process. The treatHist element allows either text or structured information when formulating the specific encoding. It is recommended to make use of p elements when a text-centred encoding is favored and to use the eventList element for a more structured encoding. Like exhibHist , treatHist is conceptually bound to the item-level in FRBR-based encodings. The element is not permitted at the work or expression level and only permitted at the manifestation level, if the manifestation is a manifestation singleton. Similar to the MEI treatHist element, the treatSched element is intended to hold records of conservation activities or treatments in regard to a bibliographic item. However, in contrast to treatHist , treatSched allows records of any anticipated activities, rather than simply a historical account of previous treatments. This might include any description indicating the quantity and frequency of the treatments. treatSched furthermore may also be used to indicate that no additions or treatments are to be expected. To that end, treatSched allows the option for either text or more structured information when formulating a specific encoding. It is at the discretion of the encoder to decide which specifics of the encoding are most appropriate.","url":"content\/metadata.html#historicalAccount","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1 Typical Use Cases","desc":"","remarks":"This chapter introduces common use cases for MEI metadata.","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerusecases","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1 Independent Headers","desc":"","remarks":"Many libraries, repositories, research sites and related institutions collect bibliographic and documentary information about machine readable music documents without necessarily collecting the music documents themselves. Such institutions may thus want access to the header of an MEI document without its attached text in order to build catalogs, indexes and databases that can be used to locate relevant texts at remote locations, obtain full documentation about those texts, and learn how to obtain them. This section describes a set of practices by which the metadata headers of MEI documents can be encoded separately from those documents and exchanged as freestanding MEI documents. Headers exchanged independently of the documents they describe are called independent headers.","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerIndependentHeader","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1.1 Independent MEI Headers","desc":" meiHead","remarks":"An independent header is an MEI metadata header that can be exchanged as an independent document between libraries, archives, collections, projects, and individuals. The structure of an independent header is exactly the same as that of an header attached to a document. This means that an meiHead can be extracted from an MEI document and sent to a receiving institution with little or no change. When deciding which information to include in the independent header, and the format or structure of that information, the following should be kept in mind: The independent header should provide full bibliographic information about the encoded text, its sources, where the text can be located, and any restrictions governing its use. The independent header should contain useful information about the encoding of the text itself. In this regard, it is highly recommended that the encoding description be as complete as possible. The Guidelines do not require that the encoding description be included in the header (since some simple transcriptions of small items may not require it), but in practice the use of a header without an encoding description would be severely limited. The independent header should be amenable to automatic processing, particularly for loading into databases and for the creation of publications, indexes, and finding aids, without undue editorial intervention on the part of the receiving institution. For this reason, two recommendations are made regarding the format or structure of the header: first, where there is a choice between a prose content model and one that contains a formal series of specialized elements, wherever possible and appropriate the specialized elements should be preferred to unstructured prose. Second, with respect to corpora, information about each of the texts within a corpus should be included in the overall corpus-level meiHead . That is, source information, editorial practices, encoding descriptions, and the like should be included in the relevant sections of the corpus meiHead , with pointers to them from the headers of the individual texts included in the corpus. There are three reasons for this recommendation: first, the corpus-level header will contain the full array of bibliographic and documentary information for each of the texts in a corpus, and thus be of great benefit to remote users, who may have access only to the independent header; second, such a layout is easier for the coder to maintain than searching for information throughout a text; and third, generally speaking, this practice results in greater overall consistency, especially with respect to bibliographic citations.","url":"content\/metadata.html#headerIndependentHeaderDefinition","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1 Including non-MEI Metadata in MEI files","desc":" extMeta expression item manifestation work meiHead","remarks":"The following element is provided to accommodate non-MEI metadata: The extMeta element may be contained by expression , item , manifestation , work and meiHead elements.

This diversity and richness reflects the diversity of uses to which it is envisaged that electronic texts conforming to these Guidelines will be put. It is emphatically not intended that all of the elements described above should be present in every MEI Header. The amount of encoding in a header will depend both on the nature and the intended use of the text. At one extreme, an encoder may expect that the header will be needed only to provide a bibliographic identification of the text adequate to local needs. At the other, wishing to ensure that their texts can be used for the widest range of applications, encoders will want to document as explicitly as possible both bibliographic and descriptive information, in such a way that no prior or ancillary knowledge about the text is needed in order to process it. The header in such a case will be very full, approximating the kind of documentation often supplied in the form of a manual. Most texts will lie somewhere between these extremes; textual corpora in particular will tend more to the latter extreme. In the remainder of this section we demonstrate first the minimal, and then a commonly recommended, level of encoding for the bibliographic information held by the MEI header. Supplying only the level of encoding required, the MEI header of a single text will look like the following example: Minimal Header Information <meiHead> <fileDesc> <titleStmt> <title>Fughette (in Gottes Namen Fahren wir - Dies sind die heil'gen zehn Gebote) for Brass Quintett : an electronic transcription <\/title> <\/titleStmt> <pubStmt> <respStmt> <corpName auth.uri=\"http:\/\/d-nb.info\/gnd\" auth=\"GND\" codedval=\"5115204-6\">Musikwissenschaftliches Seminar &lt;Detmold&gt;<\/corpName> <\/respStmt> <\/pubStmt> <\/fileDesc> <\/meiHead> The only mandatory component of the MEI Header is the fileDesc element. Within this element, titleStmt and pubStmt are required constituents. Within the title statement, a title is required. Within the pubStmt , a publisher, distributor, or other agency responsible for the file is required. While not formally required, additional information is recommended for a minimally effective header. For example, it is recommended that the person or corporate entity responsible for the creation of the encoding should be specified using respStmt within the titleStmt element. It is also recommended that information about the source, or sources, of the encoding be included. Each source element should contain at the least a loosely structured bibliographic citation that identifies the source used to construct the MEI file. Furthermore, If the electronic transcription is a member of a series of publications, the series title and publisher should be included using the seriesStmt element. It is also common for cataloging records to include genre and\/or form information, here represented by the MEI classification element. We now present the same example header, expanded to include additionally recommended information, adequate for most bibliographic purposes, in particular to allow for the creation of an AACR2-conformant bibliographic record.

The principal distinguishing characteristic of a corpus is that its components have been selected or structured according to some conscious set of design criteria. In MEI, a corpus is regarded as a composite text because, although each discrete document in a corpus clearly has a claim to be considered as a text in its own right, it is also regarded as a subdivision of some larger object, if only for convenience of analysis. In corpora, the component samples are clearly distinct texts, but the systematic collection, standardized preparation, and common markup of the corpus often make it useful to treat the entire corpus as a unit, too. Corpora share a number of characteristics with other types of composite texts, including anthologies and collections. Most notably, different components of composite texts may exhibit different structural properties, thus potentially requiring elements from different MEI modules. Aside from these high-level structural differences, and possibly differences of scale, the encoding of language corpora and the encoding of individual texts present identical sets of problems. Therefore, any of the encoding techniques and elements presented in other chapters of these Guidelines may therefore prove relevant to some aspect of corpus encoding and may be used in corpora.","url":"content\/metadata.html#corpus","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1.1 Corpus Module Overview","desc":" meiCorpus mei meiHead music group","remarks":"The meiCorpus module defines a single element: The meiCorpus element is intended for the encoding of corpora, though it may also be useful in encoding any collection of disparate materials. The individual samples in the corpus are encoded as separate mei elements, and the entire corpus is enclosed in an meiCorpus element. Each sample has the usual structure for a mei document, comprising an meiHead followed by a music element. The corpus, too, has a corpus-level meiHead element, in which the corpus as a whole, and encoding practices common to multiple samples may be described. The overall structure of an MEI-conformant corpus is thus: Example of meiCorpus <meiCorpus> <meiHead type=\"corpus\"> <!-- metadata for the corpus --> <\/meiHead> <mei> <meiHead type=\"text\"> <!-- metadata for sample 1 --> <\/meiHead> <music> <!-- the encoding of sample 1 --> <\/music> <\/mei> <mei> <meiHead type=\"text\"> <!-- metadata for sample 2 --> <\/meiHead> <music> <!-- the encoding of sample 2 --> <\/music> <\/mei> <\/meiCorpus> This two-level structure allows for metadata to be specified at the corpus level, at the individual text level, or at both. However, metadata which relates to the whole corpus rather than to its individual components should be removed from the individual component metadata and included only in the meiHead element prefixed to the whole. In some cases, the design of a corpus is reflected in its internal structure. For example, a corpus of musical incipits might be arranged to combine all compositions of one type (symphonies, songs, chamber music, etc.) into some higher-level grouping, possibly with sub-groups for date of publication, instrumentation, key, etc. The meiCorpus element provides no support for reflecting such internal structure in the markup: it treats the corpus as an undifferentiated series of components, each tagged with an mei element. If it is essential to reflect the organization of a corpus into sub-components, then the members of the corpus should be encoded as composite texts instead, using the group element described section . The mechanisms for corpus characterization described in this chapter, however, are designed to reduce the need to do this. Useful groupings of components may easily be expressed using the classification and identification elements described in section , and those for associating declarations with corpus components described in section . These mechanisms also allow several different methods of text grouping to co-exist, each to be used as needed at different times. This helps minimize the danger of cross-classification and mis-classification of samples, and helps improve the flexibility with which parts of a corpus may be characterized for different applications. All composite texts share the characteristic that their different component texts may be of structurally similar or dissimilar types. If all component texts may all be encoded using the same module, then no problem arises. If however they require different modules, then the various modules must all be included in the schema.","url":"content\/metadata.html#corpusModuleOverview","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"3.1.1.1 Combining Corpus and Text Headers","desc":" titleStmt fileDesc","remarks":"An MEI-conformant document may have more than one header only in the case of a TEI corpus, which must have a header in its own right, as well as the obligatory header for each text. Every element specified in a corpus-header is understood as if it appeared within every text header in the corpus. An element specified in a text header but not in the corpus header supplements the specification for that text alone. If any element is specified in both corpus and text headers, the corpus header element is over-ridden for that text alone. The titleStmt for a corpus text is understood to be prefixed by the titleStmt given in the corpus header. All other optional elements of the fileDesc should be omitted from an individual corpus text header unless they differ from those specified in the corpus header. All other header elements behave identically, in the manner documented in chapter . This makes it possible to state information which is common to the whole of the corpus in the corpus header, while still allowing for individual texts to vary from this common metadata.

For most large-scale corpus projects, it will therefore be necessary to determine a subset of recommended elements appropriate to the anticipated needs of the project; these mechanisms include the ability to exclude selected element types, add new element types, and change the names of existing elements. Because of the high cost of identifying and encoding many textual features, and the difficulty in ensuring consistent practice across very large corpora, encoders may find it convenient to divide the set of elements to be encoded into the following four categories: required texts included within the corpus will always encode textual features in this category, should they exist in the text recommended textual features in this category will be encoded wherever economically and practically feasible; where present but not encoded, a note in the header should be made. optional textual features in this category may or may not be encoded; no conclusion about the absence of such features can be inferred from the absence of the corresponding element in a given text. proscribed textual features in this category are deliberately not encoded; they may be transcribed as unmarked up text, or represented as gap elements, or silently omitted, as appropriate.","url":"content\/metadata.html#corpusRecommendations","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"B4 Repertoire: Common Music Notation","desc":"","remarks":"The module described in this chapter offers the means to describe music in so-called ‘Common Music Notation’ (CMN, sometimes referred to as ‘Common Western Music Notation’).

It is used as a structural unit inside section elements and acts as a container for ‘events’ from the model.eventLike class, such as notes, chords and rests as well as ‘control events’ from the model.controlEventLike class, such as slurs and indications of dynamics. The following example demonstrates the use of the measure element: <section> <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <chord dur=\"1\"> <note oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"\/> <\/chord> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer> <note dur=\"1\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <\/section> A measure slices the flow of a score or part into chunks that normally comply with a duration determined by the meter defined within a preceding scoreDef or staffDef element. Each staff in the source material is represented by a staff element. As the order of the staff elements in the file does not have to reflect their order in the original document, to eliminate confusion they should always refer to a staffDef element, using either an n or def attribute. Whereas the def attribute uses the xs:anyURI datatype, the n value refers to the closest preceding staffDef or layerDef with the same value in its n attribute. <staffDef n=\"3\" xml:id=\"cmn_staffDef1\" \/> <!-- later in the file: --> <staff def=\"#cmn_staffDef1\"> <!-- @def refers to staffDef with this identifier --> <!-- staff content --> <\/staff> <!-- or: --> <staff n=\"3\"> <!-- @n refers to staffDef with this numeric label --> <!-- staff content --> <\/staff> Each staff may hold a number of layer elements to reflect multiple ‘voices’. Just as with staff , the order of the layer elements in the file does not have to reflect their original order in the document, so they also possess n and def attributes for association with the appropriate layer definition. <staffDef> <layerDef n=\"1\" xml:id=\"cmn_layerDef1\"\/> <\/staffDef> Later in the file: <section xml:id=\"cmn_staffDef1\"> <staff def=\"#cmn_staffDef1\"> <layer def=\"#cmn_layerDef1\"> <!-- layer content --> <\/layer> <\/staff> <!-- OR: --> <staff n=\"3\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <!-- layer content --> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/section>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnMeasures","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1 Defining Score Parameters for CMN","desc":" scoreDef keySig staffDef staffGrp layerDef label labelAbbr score part staff measure layer att.meterSigDefault.log att.keySigDefault.log att.pages att.systems att.textStyle att.notationStyle att.lyricStyle att.cleffing.log clef clefGrp keyAccid meterSig meterSigGrp","remarks":"When encoding a score in CMN, MEI relies on the following elements from the module: A scoreDef element is used to specify the common parameters of a score, e.g. , key and meter. The most important attributes for this purpose are: The following example describes a score in common time with 3 flats: <scoreDef keysig=\"3f\" meter.count=\"4\" meter.sym=\"common\" meter.unit=\"4\"\/> For encoding more complex time signatures, simple mathematical symbols such as asterisks and plus signs are allowed in meter.count . Non-standard key signatures have to be encoded with a keySig element. Other attributes allow the description of default page and system margins and fonts for text and music: There are other attributes that allow the specification of many further details of a score. These are available from the element definitions accessible at scoreDef , staffDef , staffGrp and layerDef . When content is provided for scoreDef , it must contain a staffGrp element. This element is used to gather individual staves and other staff groups. This is useful for collecting instrumental or vocal groups in a large score, such as woodwinds, brasses, etc., and for assigning a shared label to the group, using the label and labelAbbr subelements. The staffGrp element is also used for the two staves of a grand staff. The bar.thru attribute on staffGrp allows one to specify whether bar lines are drawn across the space between staves of that group or only on the staves themselves. A staffDef element is used to describe an individual staff of a score or performer part . It bears most of the attributes described above. The label and labelAbbr subelements may be used for providing staff labels for the first and subsequent systems. Every staffDef must have an n attribute with an integer as its value. The first occurrence of a staffDef with a given number must also indicate the number of staff lines via the lines attribute. The order of staffDef elements within scoreDef follows the order of staves in the source document or planned rendering. The individual staff elements within a measure refer to these staffDef declarations using their own n attribute values. Therefore, the encoding order of staves within a measure does not have to mimic the order of the staffDef elements with scoreDef . In addition to the parameters inherited from scoreDef , the following attributes are important for staffDef elements: A staff with a tenor clef is encoded as in the following example: <staffDef clef.dis=\"8\" clef.dis.place=\"below\" clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\"\/> In the case of transposing instruments, the key-related attributes described above may be used to override the written key expressed in the scoreDef element. As a basic principle, MEI always captures written pitches, so the trans.diat and trans.semi attributes may be used to indicate the number of diatonic steps and semitones to calculate sounded pitch from written pitch. The piccolo and E♭ clarinet staves in the example below utilize these attributes: <scoreDef meter.count=\"6\" meter.unit=\"8\"> <staffGrp> <!-- Piccolo sounds 12 semitones higher than written (and encoded in MEI). --> <staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.mode=\"major\" keysig=\"4f\" label=\"Piccolo\" label.abbr=\"Picc.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"1\" trans.diat=\"0\" trans.semi=\"12\" xml:id=\"cmn.P1\"\/> <staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.mode=\"major\" keysig=\"4f\" label=\"Flute\" label.abbr=\"Fl.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"2\" xml:id=\"cmn.P2\"\/> <staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.mode=\"major\" keysig=\"4f\" label=\"Oboe\" label.abbr=\"Ob.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"3\" xml:id=\"cmn.P3\"\/> <staffDef clef.line=\"4\" clef.shape=\"F\" key.mode=\"major\" keysig=\"4f\" label=\"Bassoon\" label.abbr=\"Bsn.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"4\" xml:id=\"cmn.P4\"\/> <!-- Clarinet sounds a minor third (two diatonic steps or three semitones) higher than written. --> <staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.mode=\"major\" keysig=\"1f\" label=\"Clarinet in E♭\" label.abbr=\"E♭ Cl.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"5\" trans.diat=\"2\" trans.semi=\"3\" xml:id=\"cmn.P5\"\/> <\/staffGrp> <\/scoreDef> There are a number of additional elements that can be used as children of staffDef in order to describe additional features of the staff, such as the color of a clef or a key signature added in a different hand. These elements include: With the exception of label , these elements may also occur within the flow of musical events captured in a layer , since they are members of model.eventLike . In the layer context they function as milestones and affect all following content assigned to the layer (even in subsequent measures) until their information is again overridden either by the same element bearing different information or a staffDef or scoreDef . In this context, it is also possible to combine them with the elements described in chapters and of these Guidelines. Such flexibility as this may require close inspection of an encoding to retrieve the correct definitions for a given staff. As a general rule, the closest preceding and most specific element provides this information: For example, a keySig in the preceding measure is more relevant than a staffDef at the beginning of the section, which is more relevant than a scoreDef at the beginning of the score. However, a section-specific scoreDef that provides only information about the meter does not override the more specific information about key signature gathered from a staffDef for a transposing instrument. Every staffDef may contain a number of layerDef elements, which may be used to establish default values for the distinct layers sharing one staff. MEI does not use the term ‘voice’ to describe these ‘musical threads’ because that term implies continuity across measure boundaries. Given the sometimes arbitrary relationships between these threads from measure to measure as well as across staves, MEI uses the more neutral term ‘layer’.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnDefs","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1 Special cases in staff definitions","desc":" clef key meterSig layerDef meterSigGrp","remarks":"Usually clef , key , and meterSig apply to a whole staff. In some rare cases one can find different meters in different layers, as seen in Maurice Ravel’s Oiseaux tristes . Different meters in different layers on the upper staff In these cases it is necessary to encode each meterSig for the staff as child of the corresponding layerDef : <staffGrp bar.thru=\"true\"> <staffDef n=\"1\"> <layerDef n=\"1\"> <meterSig count=\"4\" unit=\"4\" sym=\"common\" \/> <\/layerDef> <layerDef n=\"2\"> <meterSig count=\"12\" unit=\"8\" \/> <\/layerDef> <\/staffDef> <staffDef n=\"2\" lines=\"5\"> <layerDef n=\"1\"> <meterSig count=\"4\" unit=\"4\" sym=\"common\" \/> <\/layerDef> <\/staffDef> <\/staffGrp> When multiple time signatures appear next to each other the meterSigGrp element has to be used.

For example, middle C or c' (the C in the middle, i.e. , fourth C key from left, on a standard 88-key piano keyboard) is represented on the first ledger line in G clef notation and labelled as C4 , in the naming convention of SPN. The note one semitone below would be labelled B3 , and A4 would refer to the first A above C4 . The usual CMN-specific values for dur are: 1 whole note 2 half note 4 quarter note 8 eighth note 16 sixteenth note … 2048 2048th note Additionally, the following two values borrowed from mensural notation are allowed, as they sometimes also appear in CMN: breve double whole long quadruple whole Please note that their mensural counterparts bear different names in order to clearly distinguish between repertoires. Dotted durational values are accommodated by the dots attribute, which records the number of written augmentation dots. Thus, a dotted quarter note is represented as in the following example: <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"\/>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnNotesBasic","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1.1.1 Grace Notes","desc":" note chord graceGrp","remarks":"The CMN module adds two optional attributes, grace and grace.time , to note and chord . The presence of the grace attribute indicates a grace note or chord. Grace notes The encoding of the left-most example would look like this: <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"e\" stem.dir=\"up\" grace=\"unacc\" stem.mod=\"1slash\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"up\" grace=\"unacc\" stem.mod=\"1slash\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <\/beam> Grace notes are not counted when determining the measure’s conformance to the current time signature. Therefore, the dur attribute records only the written rhythmic value of the grace note. The time necessary for the performance of grace notes can be unspecified, calculated based on taking time from other non-grace notes, or specified precisely using the dur.ges attribute. The values of grace indicate from which note time is ‘borrowed’ to perform the grace note: The preceding note, in which case the value unacc (unaccented) is used, or the following note, when the value acc (accented) is appropriate. Technically, this value determines if the note following the grace will keep its original onset time or will be slightly delayed to allow the grace note itself to be accented. Sometimes it is not clear how to perform a grace; in these situations the value unknown allows one to indicate a grace note while unambiguously stating that its performed duration remains unknown. The grace.time attribute is only to be used in combination with the grace attribute. It records the amount of time (as a percentage of the written duration) that the grace note should ‘steal’ from the preceding note (when grace =\"unacc\") or the following note (when grace =\"acc\"). Grace notes can be placed within a graceGrp element, which itself allows all values for grace as explained above. The optional attach attribute is used to record whether the grace note group is attached to the following event or to the preceding one. The graceGrp element can be used with single or multiple grace notes.

In MEI the chord element functions as a container for all participating notes. Also it features many attributes that are allowed for notes, e.g. , usually all notes in a chord have a common duration, so it can be applied to the whole chord within it’s dur attribute. Some notational features like articulations or lyrics are connected to a whole chord instead of a single note. Therefore elements like artic or verse are also allowed as children of chord elements. In the following example from Sergei Rachmaninoff’s Prelude in C-sharp minor , Op. 3, No. 2 all chords carry an accent.

These symbols are placed on a note or chord’s stem and generally indicate different types of tremolo and Sprechstimme. The following values are allowed: 1slash 1 slash through stem 2slash 2 slashes through stem 3slash 3 slashes through stem 4slash 4 slashes through stem 5slash 5 slashes through stem 6slash 6 slashes through stem sprech X placed on stem z Z placed on stem The stem.mod attibute is normally used in accordance with practices described in section . The CMN module makes the att.stems.cmn attribute class available, which adds the optional stem.with attribute to note and chord . The attribute stem.with allows for the indication of a stem that joins notes on adjacent staves. Cross-staff chord The following code demonstrates one method of encoding the first chord in the last measure in the image above. The stem.with attribute must occur on all the notes or chords attached to the cross-staff stem. <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" stem.with=\"below\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <chord dur=\"2\" stem.with=\"above\"> <note accid=\"n\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\"\/> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\"\/> <\/chord> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> Alternatively, the encoder may choose to treat the notes in the lower staff as logically belonging to the top staff and to ‘displace’ them using the staff attribute on note . Some use cases, however, may require filling the time that those notes would normally occupy using the space element described in section . Using this mechanism, the example above could also be encoded like so: <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <chord dur=\"2\"> <note oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\"\/> <note accid=\"n\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" staff=\"2\"\/> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" staff=\"2\"\/> <\/chord> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <!-- the time used by the notes on staff 2 filled with non-sounding \"space\" --> <space dur=\"2\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> The choice between these two methods of representing material that crosses staves is often software-dependent. Whereas stem.with can be used to define stems that connect notes across different staves (cross-staff chords) stem.sameas is meant for describing a stem that connects two notes pertaining to different layers within the same staff. The typical scenario for stem.sameas is orchestral scores where two wind instruments are notated on one single staff. Normally, the notes have individual stems pointing in opposite directions. However, it is common engraving practice that notes of the same duration are often stemmed together between the parts encoded in separate layers. The following example demonstrates this practice in the wind instruments (bassoons and trumpets in meas. 1 - 3, horns in meas. 3) Shared stems The following code represents an encoding of shared stems in the bassoon and trumpet staff using stem.sameas . <score> <measure n=\"1\"> <!-- ... --> <staff label=\"Fagotti\" n=\"3\"> <layer n=\"1\" xml:id=\"L08\"> <note accid.ges=\"f\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" tstamp=\"1\" xml:id=\"note_2754\"\/> <note accid.ges=\"f\" dots=\"2\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" tstamp=\"2\" xml:id=\"note_2757\"\/> <note accid.ges=\"f\" dur=\"16\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" tstamp=\"2.875\" xml:id=\"note_2760\"\/> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\" xml:id=\"L10\"> <note accid.ges=\"f\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\" stem.sameas=\"#note_2754\" tstamp=\"1\" xml:id=\"note_2766\"\/> <note accid.ges=\"f\" dots=\"2\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\" stem.sameas=\"#note_2757\" tstamp=\"2\" xml:id=\"note_2769\"\/> <note accid.ges=\"f\" dur=\"16\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\" stem.sameas=\"#note_2760\" tstamp=\"2.875\" xml:id=\"note_2772\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <!-- ... --> <staff label=\"Clarini\" n=\"5\"> <layer n=\"1\" xml:id=\"L15\"> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" tstamp=\"1\" xml:id=\"note_2808\"\/> <note dots=\"2\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" tstamp=\"2\" xml:id=\"note_2811\"\/> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" tstamp=\"2.875\" xml:id=\"note_2814\"\/> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\" xml:id=\"L17\"> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" stem.sameas=\"#note_2808\" tstamp=\"1\" xml:id=\"note_2820\"\/> <note dots=\"2\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" stem.sameas=\"#note_2811\" tstamp=\"2\" xml:id=\"note_2823\"\/> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" stem.sameas=\"#note_2814\" tstamp=\"2.875\" xml:id=\"note_2826\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <!-- ... --> <\/measure> <\/score>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnChordsStems","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1.1 Rests","desc":" rest note chord mRest multiRest mSpace","remarks":"The dur attribute on rest captures the written duration of the rest and allows the same values as on note and chord .

The most common and most musician-friendly approach to this is through the use of a combination of the attributes tstamp and dur , which are made available by the attribute classes att.timestamp.log (inherited by att.controlEvent ) and att.timestamp2.log , both from the shared module. The timestamp ( tstamp ) of a musical event is calculated in relation to the meter of the current measure and resembles the so-called ‘beat’ position. In a common time measure with four quarter notes, the timestamp of each quarter equals its beat position in the measure: The first quarter has a timestamp of 1, the second has a timestamp of 2, and so on. MEI defines the value of tstamp as a real number; the second eighth note position in a measure would thus be represented by the value of \"1.5\". The range of possible values is defined as starting with zero and ending with the number of metrical units in a measure (the ‘numerator’ in a time signature) + 1. This allows the capture of all graphical positions starting from the left bar line ('0') and ending with the right bar line of the measure ('5', in the case of 4\/4 time). For expressing durations, MEI offers the dur attribute. This attribute is described in section . For ‘spanning’ elements like slurs, which are members of the model.controlEventLike class, it is often more intuitive to record two timestamps – one for the onset of the event and one for its termination. Because the termination of the event may be in a succeeding measure, the second timestamp ( tstamp2 ) has a slightly different datatype than the one marking the initiation of the event. Its datatype is constrained to values following the formula \" xm + y \", where x is the number of full measures that this particular feature lasts (or the number of bar lines crossed) and y is the timestamp in the target measure where the feature ends. The timestamp is expressed using the same logic as described above. For example, a value of \"0m+3\" in 4\/4 time indicates that the element bearing this attribute, a slur for example, ends on beat 3 of the same measure where it started. A value of \"1m+1.5\" would indicate an end on the second eighth note of the following measure. In 6\/8 time, the value \"2m+3\" means that the feature ends two measures later on the third eighth note.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnTstamp","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1 Advanced CMN Features","desc":"","remarks":"Over time, in addition to the basic features of note, chord, and rest, many other symbols have been added to CMN. The following section describes some of these symbols and introduces their handling in MEI.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnAdditionalMeasureContent","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1 Beams","desc":" beam note chord staff space beamSpan scoreDef staffDef layerDef","remarks":"A very common feature of music from the CMN repertoire is the beaming of eighth or shorter notes. MEI provides two elements for the explicit encoding of features joined by beams. Use of the beam element is straightforward. The beamed notes, rests, or chords are simply enclosed by the beam element: <layer> <beam> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <\/beam> <\/layer> Whereas in music notation every note value shorter than an eighth adds another beam (sometimes referred to as ‘secondary beams’), in MEI only one beam element is used, no matter the durations of the contained notes. The visual rendition of a set of beamed notes is presumed to be handled by rendering processes. <layer> <!-- … --> <beam> <note dur=\"16\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"16\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <\/beam> <!-- … --> <\/layer> From the 19th century onwards, it became quite common to break secondary beams to increase readability of longer beamed passages. The optional breaksec attribute on note s and chord s under the beam may be used to encode the breaking of secondary beams after the note or chord bearing the attribute. The value of breaksec indicates the number of continuous beams. For example: Primary and secondary beams <layer> <beam> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"16\"\/> <\/beam> <beam> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note breaksec=\"1\" dur=\"16\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <\/beam> <\/layer> In the music of the second half of the 20th century, it is quite common to indicate acceleration or deceleration using converging (feathered) beams as in the image below: The encoding of such a beam is accomplished using the form attribute of the beam, which allows the following values: acc Beams gradually diverge. rit Beams gradually converge (into one). mixed Beams diverge and converge arbitrarily. norm The beam is rendered as usual (default). <layer> <!-- … --> <beam form=\"acc\"> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <\/beam> <!-- … --> <\/layer> The duration of notes, rests, or chords under a beam which carries the form attribute with a value of ‘acc’, ‘rit’, or ‘mixed’ must be treated specially. The first and last contained elements must specify a duration which matches the number of beams displayed at the point of these events. In the case of a ‘mixed’ beam, each event at the point of change in the number of secondary beams must carry a dur attribute. Beams like this may be encoded thusly: Feathered beaming <layer> <!-- … --> <beam form=\"mixed\"> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <\/beam> <beam form=\"mixed\"> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <\/beam> <!-- … --> <\/layer> Two measures from No. 4 of Moszkowski’s 12 Pianoforte Studies for the left hand Beams that connect events on different staves may be encoded in two different ways. First, a single-layer approach may be taken that treats the events lying under the beam as logically belonging to the same layer as the initial event but visually ‘displaced’ to an adjacent staff. In the example above from Moritz Moszkowski’s 12 Pianoforte Studies for the left hand , Op. 92, MoszWV 117 this method makes even from a semantic perspective perfect sense. It can be achieved with an additional staff attribute value that contradicts the ‘normal’ staff placement indicated by the n attribute of their ancestor staff . <staff n=\"2\"> <layer> <!-- … --> <beam place=\"mixed\"> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" accid.ges=\"s\"\/> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\"\/> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" accid=\"s\" staff=\"1\"\/> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" accid.ges=\"s\" staff=\"1\"\/> <\/beam> <!-- … --> <\/layer> <\/staff> In other contexts however, a staff-by-staff methodology may be employed in which the notes are encoded according to the staff on which they appear. This encoding style requires that each beam element account for the total time encompassed by the beam; that is, each beam must use one or more space elements to account for the time occupied by notes on the opposing staff. For example, the time used by the first two notes of the beam must be represented on staff number 1 and the time taken by the last two notes of the beam must be filled on staff number 2. <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <beam beam.with=\"below\"> <space dur=\"8\"\/> <note oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\"\/> <note pname=\"f\"\/> <\/beam> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer> <beam beam.with=\"above\"> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note pname=\"b\"\/> <space dur=\"8\"\/> <\/beam> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> Downstream processing needs are the determining factor in the choice between the two alternative encoding methods. Due to the potential problem of overlapping hierarchies, the beam element only allows the encoding of beams that do not cross bar lines. When beams cross bar lines, the use of the beamSpan element is required. Unlike beam , the beamSpan element does not contain the beamed notes as its children. Instead, it references the xml:id values of all affected notes in its plist attribute and denotes the initial and terminal notes of the beam using startid and endid attributes. This configuration allows beams to cross measure boundaries. The following example from Erwin Schulhoff’s Violin Sonata demonstrates a typical example of such hierarchy-crossing beams: Cross-measure beam in the third movement of Schulhoff’s Sonata <beamSpan startid=\"#note1\" endid=\"#note4\" plist=\"#note1 #note2 #note3 #note4\"\/> In addition to the explicit encoding of beams accommodated by the beam and beamSpan elements and the beam attribute, MEI allows for specification of default beaming behavior using the following attributes on scoreDef , staffDef , and layerDef : beam.group Provides an example of how automated beaming (including secondary beams) is to be performed. beam.rests Indicates whether automatically-drawn beams should include rests shorter than a quarter note duration. The beam.group attribute can be used to set a default beaming pattern to be used when no beaming is indicated at the layer level. It must contain a comma-separated list of time values that add up to a measure in the current meter, e.g. , 4,4,4,4 in 4\/4 time indicates that each quarter note worth of shorter notes should be beamed together. Parentheses can be used to indicate sub-groupings of secondary beams. For example, (4.,4.,4.) in 9\/8 meter indicates one primary beam per measure with secondary beams broken at each dotted quarter duration, while (4,4),(4,4) in 4\/4 will result in a measure of 16th notes being rendered with a primary beam covering all the notes and secondary beams for each group of four 16th notes. The beam.group attribute is available on scoreDef , staffDef , and layerDef elements, making it possible to set different beaming patterns for each of these. Also, the beaming pattern can be changed anywhere score parameters may be changed, for example, at the start of sections. This beaming \"directive\" can be overridden by using beam , beamSpan , or beam attributes as described above. If none of these beaming specifications is used, then no beaming is implied. Default beaming can be explicitly ‘turned off’ by setting beam.group to an empty string.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnBeams","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1 Ties, Slurs and Phrase Marks","desc":" note chord layer tie slur phrase measure","remarks":"One of the most specific features of CMN is the use of ‘curved lines’ which connect notes. These lines are used to indicate various musical features, depending on their context. A tie is a curved line connecting two notes of the same pitch . The purpose of a tie is to join the durations of both notes, so that the first note sounds for the combined duration. In other words, there is only one onset for both notes. In MEI, ties can be encoded in different ways, depending on the level of detail that the encoder wants to preserve. The simplest solution is to use the tie attribute found on note and chord . <layer> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"i\"\/> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"t\"\/> <\/layer> This attribute allows three values: i (initial) Marks the start of a tie m (medial) Marks a participant in a tie other than the first or last t (terminal) Marks the end of a tie The scope of the tie attribute is the musical layer ; that is, a tie started in one layer may only be ended by a subsequent musical event with a tie attribute with an m or t value in the same layer. The tie-terminating event may lie in the following measure. Ties across bar lines <measure n=\"1\"> <!-- staff 1 omitted --> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <chord dur=\"16\"> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"f\" \/> <note oct=\"1\" pname=\"f\" \/> <\/chord> <beam> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"i\" \/> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"a\" tie=\"i\" \/> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\" tie=\"i\" \/> <\/beam> <chord dur=\"4\"> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"i\" \/> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\" tie=\"m\" \/> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"a\" tie=\"m\" \/> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"m\" \/> <\/chord> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <measure n=\"2\"> <!-- staff 1 omitted --> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <chord dur=\"16\"> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"t\" \/> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\" tie=\"t\" \/> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"a\" tie=\"t\" \/> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"t\" \/> <\/chord> <!-- … --> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <!-- measures 3 and 4 omitted --> When tie is used on chords, it functions as a shorthand indication for multiple tie markings; that is, a separate tie is drawn for every pitch in the chord that remains unchanged in the succeeding chord. <staff> <layer> <chord dur=\"4\" tie=\"i\"> <note pname=\"f\"\/> <note pname=\"c\"\/> <note pname=\"a\"\/> <\/chord> <chord dur=\"4\" tie=\"t\"> <note pname=\"f\"\/> <note pname=\"c\"\/> <note pname=\"a\"\/> <\/chord> <\/layer> <\/staff> This is equivalent to the following, more verbose version: <staff> <layer> <chord dur=\"4\"> <note pname=\"f\" tie=\"i\"\/> <note pname=\"c\" tie=\"i\"\/> <note pname=\"a\" tie=\"i\"\/> <\/chord> <chord dur=\"4\"> <note pname=\"f\" tie=\"t\"\/> <note pname=\"c\" tie=\"t\"\/> <note pname=\"a\" tie=\"t\"\/> <\/chord> <\/layer> <\/staff> A slur is a curved line that connects a group of notes of different pitch. It normally indicates that an instrument-specific performance technique should be applied to the affected notes. For example, in notation for winds, the notes should be played in one breath, while a single bow is indicated for string instruments. Slurs In MEI, slurs may be encoded in a similar way to ties: note and chord bear a slur attribute that allows the commencement or ending of a slur at this element. The allowed values, however, are slightly different: The i , m or t are followed by a single digit in the range 1 to 6, as in the following example: <layer> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" slur=\"i1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"m1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" slur=\"t1\"\/> <\/layer> The reason for this difference is that slurs, unlike ties, may overlap, so that a second slur may start while the first slur is still ongoing. The digit indicates the level of nesting of slurs on the note; ‘1’ indicates no nesting, while ‘2’ indicates the existence of 2 slurs in which this note participates, and so on. In the example below, the second and third quarter notes lie under 2 slurs. The second note is covered by the slur that begins on the preceding note and by the one that it starts. The third note is affected by the slur that begins on note one and by the one that starts on note two. <staff> <layer> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"i1\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" slur=\"i2\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"t2\"\/> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" slur=\"t1\"\/> <\/layer> <layer> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" slur=\"i1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" slur=\"t1\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> To support analytical operations, slur may take on more than one value. For example, the example above may be more explicitly encoded as: <staff> <layer> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"i1\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" slur=\"m1 i2\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"m1 t2\"\/> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" slur=\"t1\"\/> <\/layer> <layer> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" slur=\"i1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" slur=\"t1\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> In this encoding, the notes in the beamed group are marked as participating in two slurs – one connecting just the beamed notes and one connecting the first and last notes of the layer. In ‘nested’ slurs like this, the function of the slurs is usually different. Here, the slur connecting the 8th notes indicates legato performance, while the longer slur functions as a phrase mark. While ties are not normally allowed to cross layers or staves, slurs may. The following example demonstrates how cross-staff slurs may be encoded using the slur attribute: <measure> <staff> <layer> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"i1\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" slur=\"m1\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"m1\"\/> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" slur=\"m1\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff> <layer> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" slur=\"t1\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> Slurs and ties that cross system or page breaks are often split into two separate symbols for rendering. One slur or tie ends at the last bar line, another one starts at the beginning of the new system. MEI expects this to be the default rendering behavior, so that in situations like these, the regular tie or slur attributes are sufficient to describe both curved lines resulting from the split. Sometimes, however, one of these two symbols is missing in the document, or the encoder wants to provide additional (often visual) information about the slur or tie. In these cases, using an attribute is not an adequate solution. Therefore, MEI offers dedicated tie and slur elements. A third element, phrase , is used to identify a unified melodic idea (in German: Phrasierungsbogen ), whereas the slur element is used as a generic element for all curved lines (in German: Bogensetzung ) except ties. All three elements have nearly identical models. Another reason for using elements instead of attributes for ties, slurs, and phrase marks is that only elements may be combined with the functionality provided in chapters and of these Guidelines. Although these elements are allowed within a layer to accommodate unmeasured notation, by convention in CMN they are normally placed inside measure , after the encoding of staves, alongside other so-called ‘control events’. <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <slur\/> <tempo\/> <dynam\/> <\/measure> Obviously, to be complete the slur in the above example needs to be ‘attached’ to the notes somehow. The ‘vertical assignment’ can be indicated for the example above using the staff and layer attributes like so: <slur layer=\"1\" staff=\"1\"\/> For the ‘horizontal assignment’, the encoder may choose between two different mechanisms. The first uses two timestamp attributes as described in section . The start and end points of the slur may be indicated thusly: <slur layer=\"1\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"0m+4\"\/> By using tstamp and tstamp2 attributes, the encoder denotes a rather loose connection – the slur (or tie) is attached to a certain position in the measure, not to a specific note or chord. If the encoder wants to specify a close connection to a particular event, the startid and endid attributes may be used instead. Here, the xml:id s of the first and last note of the slur are referenced. This mechanism also allows the crossing of layers and staves. For human readability, it is recommended to encode slur , tie and phrase features in the measure where they begin; that is, in the measure that holds the element referenced by startid . On the other hand, for machine processability, it may be desirable to place slur , tie , and phrase elements in the measure where they end or even in the last measure regardless of their beginning and ending points in the music. This last option makes all references contained within these elements ‘back references’. Back references are necessary when using processing software that treats the encoded file as a stream; that is, programs that process the file without creating an in-memory representation of its contents. When using the tie , slur or phrase elements, the curvature of the line may be described using the curvedir , bulge and bezier attributes. Whereas the first attribute allows only specification of the slur’s vertical placement, the others give increasingly more precise control of the curve. If the encoder wishes to draw attention to the appearance of a slur or tie in a given source, the facs attribute may be used instead of (or in addition to) the curve description attributes to point to a graphic image or a zone within an image (see ).","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnSlurTies","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1 Dynamics in CMN","desc":" dynam slur measure staff hairpin","remarks":"Common Music Notation provides two different methodologies for expressing the volume of a note, phrase, section, etc. The first is a verbal instruction providing such information in human language, possibly in an abbreviated form. An example is the word piano , indicating a quiet volume, often abbreviated as p . In MEI, verbal instructions like this are encoded using the dynam element from the Shared module (see chapter ): <dynam>p<\/dynam> By convention, dynam elements, like slur and other elements belonging to the model.controlEventLike class, are encoded at the end of the measure to which they belong. This requires dynam to be assigned to a certain staff using the staff attribute, whose value refers to the target element’s n attribute. In the absence of other information, all layers within the staff are assumed to have the same dynamic marking. <dynam staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\">p<\/dynam> However, when the layers of a staff have different dynamic indications, the layer attribute may be used to associate a dynamic marking with a particular layer: <measure> <dynam layer=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\">p<\/dynam> <dynam layer=\"2\" tstamp=\"1\">mf<\/dynam> <\/measure> A suitable MIDI value may be assigned to a dynamic marking using the val attribute: <dynam layer=\"1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"1\" val=\"84\">f<\/dynam> The location of a dynamic marking in relation to a staff may be specified using the place attribute, which may be given as above , below or within the staff or even between two staves: <dynam place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\">p<\/dynam> <!-- or --> <dynam place=\"between\" staff=\"1 2\" tstamp=\"2\">f<\/dynam> Dynamics must also be associated with a particular time point in a measure, using the tstamp , or with a particular event, using the startid attribute. Linking a control event with measures and events is discussed in section : <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" stem.mod=\"2slash\"\/> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" stem.mod=\"2slash\"\/> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/layer> <\/staff> <dynam layer=\"1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"1\">p<\/dynam> <dynam layer=\"1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> <\/measure> Dynamics which do not have an explicit endpoint are often referred to as ‘instantaneous’. On the other hand, some dynamic directions indicate a continuous change that must have a defined end point. It is possible to specify the logical scope of continuous dynamic marks using the attributes tstamp2 , dur , dur.ges , or endid . Additionally a corresponding ending value for MIDI output may be given in the val2 attribute. To capture the fact that the crescendo in the example above continue until the first beat of the next measure, they may be marked: <!-- using the tstamp2 attribute --><dynam place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\" tstamp2=\"1m+1\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> <!-- using the endid attribute --><dynam endid=\"#ID_of_ending_note\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> Any combination of tstamp , startid , tstamp2 , and endid attributes may be used to define the scope of a dynamic, although the tstamp and tstamp2 or the startid and endid combinations are the most logical combinations. For example, the following alternatives are all possibilities for encoding up a crescendo. The choice of attributes is often task or processor dependent. <!-- tstamp attribute indicates starting point, dur attribute marks the end --><dynam place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\" dur=\"1\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> <!-- tstamp attribute indicates starting point, endid attribute marks the end --><dynam endid=\"#ID_of_last_note\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> <!-- startid attribute indicates starting point, tstamp2 attribute marks the end --><dynam place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" startid=\"#ID_of_first_note\" tstamp2=\"1m+3\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> <!-- startid attribute indicates starting point, endid attribute marks the end --><dynam endid=\"#ID_of_last_note\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" startid=\"#ID_of_first_note\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> All musical elements affected by the dynam may be explicitly specified using the plist attribute, which contains xml:id attribute value references: <dynam endid=\"#note4\" place=\"above\" plist=\"#note1 #note2 #note3 #note4\" staff=\"2\" startid=\"#note1\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> It is recommended that the list of references in plist include all participants in the dynamic marking, including the first and last notes as in the preceding example, even though they are duplicated by startid and endid attributes. In addition to verbal instructions, Common Music Notation uses graphical symbols to indicate ‘continuous’ dynamics. These crescendo and decrescendo (or diminuendo) symbols are encoded in MEI using the hairpin element. It also is a member of the model.controlEventLike class, which means it too is used just before the close of a measure element, following the encoding of all staves. The required attribute form specifies the direction of the symbol by taking one of two possible values: cres (growing louder) or dim (getting softer). <hairpin form=\"cres\"\/> Marking the logical extent of hairpins is possible using the same attributes as for dynam . <hairpin form=\"cres\" layer=\"1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\" tstamp2=\"1m+1\"\/> The following example from Béla Bartók’s Mikrokosmos , Sz.107 shows a diminuendo between two staves that begins on the first beat (in the current measure) and ends on the first one in the penultimate measure. The duration is highlighted with a dashed line, which can be indicated with the extender attribute. A diminuendo in Bartók’s In Phrygian Mode <dynam tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"2m+1\" extender=\"true\" place=\"between\" staff=\"1 2\">dim.<\/dynam>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnDynam","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1 Tuplets","desc":" note tuplet rest space beam tupletSpan measure staff","remarks":"Tuplets indicate a localized change of meter; that is, a given duration in the regular meter is divided between a group of notes with irregular (according to the current meter) rhythmic values. The most common tuplet is a so-called ‘triplet’, in which three notes take the time normally occupied by two. The relation of the tuplet to the underlying meter is specified using the num and numbase attributes, where num specifies the number of replacing notes and numbase specifies the number of notes of the same duration to be replaced. For example, when three eighth notes replace one quarter note in common time, num takes a value of \"3\", whereas numbase reads \"2\", because a quarter note in common time is normally divided into two eighths. When three quarters replace two in the same meter, numbase also reads \"2\". The combination of these attributes may be read as \"3 in the time of 2\" in either case. Tuplet rhythms from Maurice Ravel’s Boléro <tuplet num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\"> <note dur=\"16\"\/> <note dur=\"16\"\/> <note dur=\"16\"\/> <\/tuplet> The duration of the entire tuplet may be encoded using the usual ‘power of 2’ values, e.g. , 1, 2, 4, etc., in the dur attribute if necessary. <layer> <tuplet dur=\"2\" num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <\/tuplet> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\"\/> <\/layer> Tuplets are often highlighted using brackets above or below the affected notes. The presence and position of these brackets can be encoded using the bracket.place (above \/ below) and bracket.visible (true \/ false) attributes. Usually, however, tuplets are rendered with a bracket ( bracket.visible =\"true\") and a single number ( num.format =\"count\" and num.visible =\"true\"), as seen in the example above. However, the number-to-numbase ratio may be provided in addition to, or in some cases as a replacement for, the bracket. The num.format attribute indicates whether a plain number (the value of num ) or a ratio (comprised of num and numbase , e.g. , \"3:2\") should be displayed and num.visible indicates the general presence of such a number. Further visual control comes with the num.place and bracket.place attributes, that allow specific placement of the number and the bracket above or below the staff. In addition to note elements, tuplet may contain other elements, such as rest or space , to match the content of a source document or an intended rendering. In particular, the beam element is allowed so that custom beaming may be indicated, e.g. , a septuplet may be divided into a group of three plus a group of four notes. The tuplet element may also be used for repetition of the same pitch; that is, a single note or chord may be the only content of the tuplet. In some cases, optical music recognition software may treat these instances as bowed tremolandi due to the knowledge of the complete semantics of the notation at the time of recognition. However, marking these as tuplets is the recommended practice. In some situations, a tuplet is made up of events in different measures. As this raises the issue of non-concurrent hierarchies, it is not possible to encode such situations with the tuplet element described above. Therefore, MEI offers the tupletSpan element, which is member of the model.controlEventLike class. It is nested inside of measure , following all the measure’s staff children. It uses the same attributes as tuplet to describe tuplets, but instead of nesting all affected notes inside itself, it references the xml:id values of all affected notes in its plist attribute and the initial and terminal notes of the tuplet using startid and endid attributes. This configuration allows tuplets to cross beams or measure boundaries. The following example demonstrates a typical example of such hierarchy-crossing tuplets: Hierarchy-crossing tuplets <tupletSpan num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\" startid=\"#rest\" endid=\"#note2\" plist=\"#rest #note1 #note2\"\/>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnTuplets","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1 Articulation and Performance Instructions in CMN","desc":" artic arpeg bend bTrem fermata fTrem gliss octave","remarks":"This section introduces elements and attributes which may hold CMN-specific performance instructions.

This behavior, called arpeggiation, is normally indicated using a vertical wavy line preceding the chord. MEI offers the arpeg element to describe arpeggios. This element is a member of the model.controlEventLike.cmn class and, like other members of this class, uses the staff , layer and tstamp or the startid and plist attributes to connect it to the affected chord. <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer> <note dur=\"4\"\/> <note dur=\"4\"\/> <chord dur=\"4\"> <!-- notes omitted --> <\/chord> <note\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <arpeg staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"\/> <\/measure> For arpeggios that involve chords spanning multiple staves as a continuous arpeggio (instead of two separate arpeggios), the plist attribute should be used to point to all affected chord and single note elements’ xml:id attributes. Therefore, the use of the plist attribute is sufficient in many cases, so that other attributes from above may be omitted. Spanning arpeggios in Liszt’s Mazeppa study <arpeg xml:id=\"ex-0149852838\" plist=\"#ex-0731379794 #ex-1553574041\" \/> <arpeg xml:id=\"ex-1483377242\" plist=\"#ex-1474174387 #ex-0553655856\" \/> The usual direction for the performance of an arpeggio is from lowest note to highest, but this is not always the case. The customary signal of an downward arpeggio is an arrowhead added to the bottom of the wavy line. The indication of the presence of an arrowhead and the direction of the arpeggio are handled separately, however. The arrow attribute indicates the presence of an arrowhead in the arpeggiation sign, while the order attribute records the preferred sequence of notes. Béla Bartók uses a wavy line behind the chord to indicate a downward arpeggio. In such cases, the ho attribute can be used to indicate the offset from the usual position. The following examples illustrate various ways in which the arrow and order attributes may be employed. The default visual rendition and performance are assumed in the absence of both attributes, while the typical downward arpeggio is indicated by the presence of both attributes. The last two possibilities occur less frequently, but are sometimes appropriate: The presence of the arrow attribute without the order attribute may be used in those cases where the arrowhead is redundant but is added to the symbol for the sake of consistency or when the direction of successive arpeggios changes frequently. The last possibility, an order attribute without an arrow attribute, is ambiguous; however, it can be used as an encoding shortcut since a downward arpeggio must have a visual indication of its direction to distinguish it from the upward arpeggio; therefore, the presence of the arrowhead can be implied. <!-- default visualization and performance --><arpeg staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"\/> <!-- downward arpeggio with arrow added to visual symbol --><arpeg arrow=\"true\" order=\"down\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"\/> <!-- default rendition with (redundant) arrow added to the top of the visual symbol --><arpeg arrow=\"true\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"\/> <!-- downward arpeggio with no visual indication of order --><arpeg order=\"down\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"\/> A third, and somewhat counter-intuitive, value for order , nonarp , indicates that no arpeggio shall be performed. Normally rendered as a bracket instead of a wavy line, this form of arpeggio is used to indicate a non-arpeggiated chord intervening in a sequence of arpeggiated ones. This is common in music for the harp, where arpeggiation is the usual method of performing chords and deviation from the norm must be explicitly indicated. Whereas an arpeggio ‘staggers’ the onset times of the notes of a chord, a glissando denotes a situation where the pitch ‘slides’ from one note to another. It makes no difference whether this slide produces distinct intermediate pitches (as on the piano) or not (as on the trombone), though the latter is sometimes referred to as portamento. The visual appearance of a glissando, which MEI encodes as gliss , is normally a line connecting two notes in the glissando. A simple glissando in Tárrega’s Alborada from a leading grace note <gliss startid=\"#startgliss\" endid=\"#endgliss\"\/> The gliss element is a member of the model.controlEventLike class and therefore, like other control events, it occurs inside a measure after the staves and uses its staff , layer , tstamp , tstamp2 , startid and endid attributes to connect it to the affected notes or chords. It is a semantic error not to specify a starting point attribute.

The first is a rapid repetition of a single pitch or chord, whereas the second is a rapid alternation between two different notes or chords. In addition, either species of tremolo may be measured or unmeasured. A measured tremolo is an abbreviation for written-out notation; that is, the tremolo is intended to be perceived as notes with distinct rhythmic values. On the other hand, in an unmeasured tremolo no specific number of alternations is intended. For the repetition of a single note or chord, MEI offers the bTrem (bowed tremolo) element, which is a member of the model.eventLike.cmn class, meaning it is encoded following the normal course of musical events within a layer . It holds exactly one note or chord element that is to be repeated.

The stem.mod attribute must also be explicity set on the child note or chord element for a complete visual representation. The example above shows a short excerpt from the second movement of Franz Schubert’s String Quartet in G major, D. 887 . However, the number of slashes present on the note may disagree with the number of slashes that should be present according to the unitdur attribute, especially in music manuscripts. <bTrem unitdur=\"64\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" stem.mod=\"2slash\"\/> <\/bTrem> Note that within beams the number of slashes should be adjusted anyway. <beam> <bTrem unitdur=\"32\"> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" stem.mod=\"2slash\"\/> <\/bTrem> <bTrem unitdur=\"32\"> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"16\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" stem.mod=\"1slash\"\/> <\/bTrem> <\/beam> The bTrem element can be used as shorthand for a tuplet consisting of repetitions of a single note or chord. This kind of markup may be the result of an optical music recognition process in which complete semantics cannot be determined a priori . When used this way, the num attribute on bTrem can record a number to be rendered along with the pseudo-tuplet. In spite of this capability, the tuplet element is preferred. This makes the following examples’ visual appearance equal, but not necessarily their semantics. <bTrem num=\"3\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" stem.mod=\"3slash\"\/> <\/bTrem> <tuplet num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\"> <bTrem> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" stem.mod=\"3slash\"\/> <\/bTrem> <\/tuplet> In the case of alternating pitches, MEI offers the fTrem (fingered tremolo) element.

It is usually written as a dot above or below an arc. It may stand above or below the staff it affects with its ‘open’ side usually facing towards the staff. A fermata indicates that a related note or rest should be held longer than its written duration would normally require. Sometimes, a fermata occurs over or under a bar line to indicate a pause or even the end of a phrase or section. The probably most famous fermatas in history from Beethoven’s fifth symphony In MEI, fermatas may be encoded using an attribute on elements like note , chord or rest . This attribute allows placement of a fermata above or below the element to which it’s attached. Fermatas in Mozart’s String Quartet K. 428 indicating general pauses <mRest fermata=\"above\"\/> However, if there is further (visual) information about the fermata that should be addressed in the encoding, MEI offers the fermata element.

The settings for these pedals occur at the beginning of the harp notation and\/or whenever it is necessary to change the harp’s tuning. These settings may be rendered using letter pitches (in the order of the pedals from left to right) or in a diagrammatic fashion, such as the form invented by Carlos Salzedo . In MEI, harp pedal settings are encoded using the harpPedal element. It is a member of the model.controlEventLike.cmn class and is therefore placed within measure , following all staff children. The staff and layer attributes may be used to assign it to a certain staff or layer . Either a tstamp or startid attribute must be used to indicate the placement within the measure (see and for further details about those linking mechanisms). The musical intention of the element is described using the c , d , e , f , g , a and b attributes, which affect the corresponding strings of the harp. All of these attributes may take the values f (flat), s (sharp) or n (natural), where a natural is the default value, which is assumed when one of these attributes is not specified. Harp pedal diagrams <measure> <!-- staves omitted --> <harpPedal tstamp=\"1\" c=\"s\" b=\"f\" e=\"f\"\/> <\/measure> In the first diagram of the preceding example, the B, and E pedals are in the flat position, while the C pedal is in sharp position.

In MEI, these symbols are encoded using the pedal element. As a member of the model.controlEventLike.cmn class, it is located within measure and refers to a staff, layer and timestamp using the staff , layer and tstamp attributes. Alternatively, the startid attribute may be used to identify a note or chord to which the mark should be assigned. The meaning of the mark is captured using the dir attribute, which provides the following values: down depress the pedal up release the pedal bounce release, then immediately depress the pedal again half depress the pedal half way <measure> <!-- staves omitted --> <pedal dir=\"down\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"1\"\/> <\/measure> To specify the pedal, that has to be used, the func attribute allows the following values: sustain The sustain pedal, also referred to as the \"damper\" pedal, allows the piano strings to vibrate sympathetically with the struck strings. It is the right-most and the most frequently used pedal on modern pianos. (Often marked with: ) soft The soft pedal, sometimes called the \"una corda\", \"piano\", or \"half-blow\" pedal, reduces the volume and modifies the timbre of the piano. On the modern piano, it is the left-most pedal. sostenuto The sostenuto or tone-sustaining pedal allows notes already undamped to continue to ring while other notes are damped normally; that is, on their release by the fingers. This is usually the center pedal of the modern piano. (Often marked with: ) silent The silent or practice pedal mutes the volume of the piano so that one may practice quietly. It is sometimes a replacement for the sostenuto pedal, especially on an upright or vertical instrument.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnPedal","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1.1 Fingering","desc":" fing","remarks":"A common feature for keyboard music is fingering, indicating the finger, which should be used to play a single note.

An ossia often provides a simpler (easier to perform) version of the original content. Another frequent use case for ossia is the provision of indications about performance practice, such as an alternative version with ornamentation written out in full. In all cases, it is up to the performer to choose between the alternatives. Most often an ossia is rendered above the main staff on a reduced-size staff. Sometimes, however, the alternate material occurs on the same staff as the primary text, but in a separate layer. In this case, the alternative material is usually rendered in small-sized notation on the normal-sized staff. For both situations, MEI offers the ossia element, which may be nested either inside measure to reflect an ossia on a separate staff, or inside staff to reflect an inline ossia in a separate layer. The following example demonstrates an ossia on a separate staff: <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- first staff, without ossia --> <\/staff> <ossia> <oStaff> <!-- alternative content on reduced-size staff --> <\/oStaff> <staff n=\"2\"> <!-- original content on regular staff --> <\/staff> <\/ossia> <staff n=\"3\"> <!-- third staff, without ossia --> <\/staff> <\/measure> The example above shows a oStaff element and a staff element within ossia . This mechanism allows one to distinguish between the \"regular\" and the \"alternative\" content: The normal staff goes in line with the preceding measure’s staff, the oStaff contains the alternative and is printed in reduced size above. In combination with the presence of an n attribute multiple simultaneous ossia staves may be encoded. All staves within ossia , even the alternative ones without a direct reference, obey the definitions of the associated staffDef , which can be derived from the value of the n attribute. Alternatively, a separate staffDef may be given at the beginning of the contained layer element(s). In case of an inline ossia, the alternative content is held in an oLayer element, as seen in the following example: <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <ossia> <layer n=\"1\"> <!-- original content in regular layer --> <\/layer> <oLayer> <!-- alternative content in separate layer --> <\/oLayer> <\/ossia> <\/staff> <staff n=\"3\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <\/measure>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnOssia","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1 Cue","desc":" layer","remarks":"Cue notes are smaller notes that usually occur in an orchestral or vocal part and are not to be played or sung by the corresponding musician, but by other instruments or singers.

This indication, such as \"Allegro moderato\" or \"Andante maestoso\", may be regarded as a label. Though it is possible to label the movement, etc. using a label attribute attached to the enclosing structural entity (that is, on mdiv or section ), it is often required to capture the exact position, spelling, or other features of the label as found in the underlying source material. In these cases, an element is necessary. Labels which address the tempo at which the music should be performed should be encoded using the tempo element, which is a specialized form of dir . tempo is a member of the model.controlEventLike class and as such occurs as a child of measure , following all staff children. Its staff , layer and tstamp attributes are used to ensure correct semantic positioning, and place indicates a visual position with respect to the staff. <measure n=\"1\"> <!-- all staves omitted --> <tempo place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\">Allegro moderato<\/tempo> <\/measure>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnTempo","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1.1 Rehearsal marks","desc":" reh rend","remarks":"Rehearsal marks are another specialized kind of directive. Consisting of letters, numbers, or a combination of both, rehearsal marks are used in scores and corresponding performer parts to identify convenient points to restart rehearsal after breaks or interruptions. For this reason, they are often visually emphasized by placing them within a square or circle. In MEI, they are encoded using the reh element, which holds the textual content of the rehearsal mark. It is a member of the model.controlEventLike.cmn class. The visual rendition of the rehearsal mark, including the surrounding shape, may be captured using the rend element described in chapter . The following detail from an edition of Hector Berlioz’ Symphonie Fantastique shows a typical example: Rehearsal mark <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"3\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <reh place=\"above\" staff=\"1\"> <rend rend=\"box\">37<\/rend> <\/reh> <\/measure> As rehearsal marks usually are placed at the beginning of a measure the tstamp attribute may be omitted. To place it anywhere else the startid , tstamp or even ho attributes could be used. The following example demonstrates how rehearsal marks often apply to more than one staff. In this instance, the rehearsal mark is placed above staff 1 and below staves 7 and 11. <measure> <reh place=\"above\" staff=\"1\">A<\/reh> <reh place=\"below\" staff=\"7 11\">A<\/reh> <\/measure>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnReh","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1 Repetition in CMN","desc":"","remarks":"Repetition is a characteristic feature of music. Many musical forms rely on repetition (sometimes with modification) of distinct sections of the music. Repetition in this sense can be thought of as ‘structural’.

Many of these symbols are found in manuscripts and may be regarded as personal conventions of their respective authors. Some signs, however, have been widely adopted. For example, it is common to indicate the repetition of a single beat or an entire measure with one or more diagonal lines, sometimes with dots at the upper left and lower right, much like a percent sign. The illustration below contains the most common signs: Beat repeat signs In general, MEI places primary emphasis on the capture of the semantic meaning of symbols, not their visual rendition. In this case, the focus is on the material being repeated, for example, a beat, a measure, a 2-measure fragment, etc. The following elements are provided for this purpose: The beatRpt element is used to represent a single repeated beat. Its visual rendition can be recorded using the slash attribute. This attribute indicates the number of slashes required to render the appropriate repeat symbol, which, as demonstrated in the preceding figure, depends on the rhythmic content of the beat being repeated. When a beat that consists of a single note or chord is repeated, the repetition sign is typically rendered as a single thick, slanting slash; therefore, the value 1 should be used. The following values should be used when the beat is divided into even notes: 4ths or 8ths=1, 16ths=2, 32nds=3, 64ths=4, 128ths=5. When the beat is comprised of mixed duration values, the symbol is always rendered as 2 slashes and 2 dots. In addition to its indication of a repeated beat, the beatRpt element is sometimes used in popular music notation, especially in guitar or percussion parts, to indicate a repeated rhythmic pattern. The beatRpt element can be used, but when these parts require durations longer or shorter than a beat, note elements with appropriately-shaped note heads should be employed instead. The mRpt element is available for repetition of an entire measure. Like mRest , it must be the sole child of layer , no other events should be used. The n attribute of mRpt should not be used to record the number displayed above the measure in the figure below. Instead, the numbering of repetitions of the written-out measure can be enabled using the multi.number attribute available on the scoreDef and staffDef elements.

This practice mostly occurs in hand-written notation and usually involves the repetition of the second half of a measure in duple time. This element is necessary because the function of the symbol, not the visual symbol itself, is of primary importance. The following example from the beginning of Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata illustrates such usage: Half-measure repeat <section> <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <!-- omitted --> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\"> <chord dur=\"2\" stem.mod=\"1slash\"> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"g\"> <\/note> <note oct=\"1\" pname=\"b\"> <\/note> <\/chord> <halfmRpt\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <!-- omitted --> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\"> <halfmRpt\/> <halfmRpt\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <\/section> As seen in the example above, it is possible to continuously repeat half measures, even across bar lines. The mRpt2 and multiRpt elements (like the multiRest element) never occur in scores, only in performer parts, where it is often necessary to abbreviate the notation due to page size limitations. Two-measure repetition Multi-measure repetition The mRpt2 element represents repetition of a 2-measure fragment, while multiRpt is for repetition of fragments longer than two measures. In modern publishing practice, repeats of more than two measures are written out using repeat signs. This element is provided, however, for handling non-standard practices often found in manuscripts. The num attribute on multiRpt records the number of preceding measures to be repeated. All elements described above allow for association of the sign with a symbol in a digital facsimile (via the facs attribute) and with a user-defined symbol (using altsym ). See and for further details. In addition, the expand attribute is available on the foregoing elements to inform a rendering process whether to use the repeat symbol or the full content represented by it. A value of true indicates that the content should be displayed, while a false value means to show only the repeat symbol.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnRepSym","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1 Common Music Notation Ornaments","desc":"","remarks":"This module includes elements and attributes for the encoding of ornaments typical of ‘Common Music Notation’ (CMN). Ornaments are formulae of embellishment that can be realized by adding supplementary notes to one or more notes of the melody. In written form, these are usually expressed as symbols written above or below a note, though some have a more complex written expression, such as those that involve multiple notes and\/or include grace notes. These symbols may have different resolutions depending on a large number of factors, such as historical context, national boundaries, composer, scribe, etc. The elements described here, therefore, are not bound to a specific symbol; they are, instead, meant to encode the encoder’s interpretation of a symbol and its position on the staff. Nonetheless, in order to establish common ground, the guidelines suggest commonly accepted symbols and realizations for the ornaments supported by MEI. The following sections will introduce each element in detail for all types of ornaments supported.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnOrnaments","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1 Encoding Common To All Ornaments","desc":" measure staff","remarks":"When encoding CMN, ornaments should be encoded within a measure , following the staff elements, and connected to events on the staff via attributes. The startid attribute is used to refer to the xml:id of the starting note. Additionally, if the ornament involves more than one events on the staff, the endid attribute can be used to anchor the ornament to a concluding event. The following example demonstrates the encoding of a mordent over a middle C: <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"co_1_n1\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <mordent place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" startid=\"#co_1_n1\"\/> <\/measure> Alternatively, the relationship of an ornament to a note can be expressed in terms of beats with the attribute tstamp . If the ornament involves more than one event on the staff, the tstamp2 attribute can be used to indicate the ending time stamp, as is explained in section . These methods may also be utilized simultaneously. The following example shows the use of tstamp for an ornament.

It is, in fact, a semantic error not to specify a starting event or time stamp for an ornament. In their resolution, ornaments will involve auxiliary notes, which typically follow the key signature or the scale of the current key. When the ornament involves other chromatic auxiliaries, an accidental is expressed next to or above the ornament sign. The attributes accidlower and accidupper , available on all ornaments described in this chapter, can be used to record this accidental. The attribute values ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ indicate whether the accidental is associated with an upper or lower auxiliary note, not the position of the accidental sign.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnOrnamentsAll","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"4.1.1.1 Overriding Default Resolutions","desc":" meiHead encodingDesc choice","remarks":"The symbols and sounded resolutions suggested for each ornament in this chapter are to be considered defaults.

Strategies to clarify the encoding and interpretation of ornaments have been discussed in section above. However, in order to aid the encoder in making educated choices in the encoding of non-standard trills, this section shows two examples diverging from modern standard use. The abbreviation \"tr\" followed by a wavy line spanning multiple notes is sometimes used to indicate multiple trills: Example of multiple trills. The encoding of this kind of trill may vary depending on the purpose of the encoding. For representation of the source, a single trill is sufficient: <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"up\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" stem.dir=\"up\"\/> <rest dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"e\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"0m+4\"\/> <\/measure> To support analytical and aural rendering applications, however, each trill may be explicitly encoded, as the following example demonstrates: <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"up\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" stem.dir=\"up\"\/> <rest dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"e\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"\/> <trill accidupper=\"f\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\"\/> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"3.5\"\/> <trill accidupper=\"s\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"4\"\/> <\/measure> However, when it is necessary to support multiple outputs, use of the choice element and appropriate sub-elements is recommended. In this case, the orig and reg elements can be used to represent the original source and a regularization provided by the editor, respectively: <choice> <orig> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"0m+4\"\/> <\/orig> <reg> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"\/> <trill accidupper=\"f\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\"\/> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"3.5\"\/> <trill accidupper=\"s\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"4\"\/> <\/reg> <\/choice> Another situation that requires disambiguation of an ornament’s name and its potential rendition is due to the fact that the symbols for trills and mordents have been often used interchangeably in the past. The following example, taken from Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach (1720), shows a trill ( Trillo ) identified by the symbol associated with a mordent in modern practice. Nonetheless, J.S. Bach’s suggested resolution should be encoded with a variant of the procedure presented above. In the example below, the child elements of choice ; that is, orig and reg , represent non-exclusive options; that is, both may be processed by applications that aim to support both visual and aural renditions.

Historically, mensural notation preceded the development of Common Music Notation (CMN) and it included a wide range of features that persist in CMN and that can be encoded in a standard manner in MEI. In mensural notation, pitches are notated as in CMN, leaving out here the major exception of musica ficta . The pitch is given by the position of the note on the staff and the current clef as in CMN, and the mensural module introduces no modification to MEI regarding how pitches are encoded. There are a number of differences, however, in the representation of duration in mensural notation. The mensural module introduces specific attribute values for notes and rests for appropriately encoding mensural durations. One of the main differences is that the duration of a note is not determined by its symbol, but also by the meter and the context in which the symbol appears in relation to other notes and rests in the same voice. The meter is given by one of the 16 mensural species provided by four levels of division: modus major , modus minor , tempus and prolatio . In the case of triple meter and depending on the specific context where the note is positioned, certain rules must be applied in order to determine the duration of a note. In these cases, encoding both the sign and its actual duration is highly recommended (as will be shown in ). Another difference is the use of proportions that are indicated by numeric ratios or by specific mensuration signs. The proportions indicate that the durations have to be modified and they may be combined. Proportions and mensuration signs were eventually simplified and became time signatures in CMN. The attributes and elements available in this module for encoding mensural signs and proportions can be found below (see and ). In mensural notation, notes can also be notated in ligatures that regroup two or more notes. Ligatures were a legacy from an earlier notation system that were still widely used in Renaissance music notation. They gradually disappeared during the seventeenth century. The mensural module provides multiple ways of encoding the ligatures.","url":"content\/mensural.html","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"5.1 Durations","desc":" note rest","remarks":"When the mensural module is included, dur on note , rest , and other elements takes the following values (from the Latin names of notes): maxima Two or three times as long as a longa longa Two or three times as long as a brevis brevis Two or three times as long as a semibrevis semibrevis Half or one-third as long as a brevis minima Half or one-third as long as a semibrevis semiminima Half as long as a minima fusa Half as long as a semiminima semifusa Half as long as a fusa The upper staff shows the different mensural note shapes and the lower staff shows the different mensural rests <?xml-model href=\"https:\/\/music-encoding.org\/schema\/dev\/mei-all.rng\" type=\"application\/xml\" schematypens=\"http:\/\/relaxng.org\/ns\/structure\/1.0\"?> <?xml-model href=\"https:\/\/music-encoding.org\/schema\/dev\/mei-all.rng\" type=\"application\/xml\" schematypens=\"http:\/\/purl.oclc.org\/dsdl\/schematron\"?> <mei xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.music-encoding.org\/ns\/mei\" meiversion=\"6.0-dev\"> <meiHead> <fileDesc> <titleStmt> <title>Notes and Rests<\/title> <\/titleStmt> <pubStmt> <date isodate=\"2023\">2023<\/date> <respStmt> <corpName>Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) Board<\/corpName> <\/respStmt> <availability> <useRestrict label=\"license\" auth=\"https:\/\/spdx.org\/licenses\/\" codedval=\"ECL-2.0\"> <p>Educational Community License v2.0<\/p> <\/useRestrict> <\/availability> <\/pubStmt> <seriesStmt> <title>MEI guidelines examples<\/title> <\/seriesStmt> <notesStmt> <annot>The upper staff shows the different mensural note shapes and the lower staff shows the different mensural rests.<\/annot> <\/notesStmt> <\/fileDesc> <\/meiHead> <music> <body> <mdiv> <score> <scoreDef> <staffGrp> <staffDef label=\"notes\" n=\"1\" notationtype=\"mensural.white\" lines=\"5\" clef.shape=\"G\" clef.line=\"2\" \/> <staffDef label=\"rests\" n=\"2\" notationtype=\"mensural.white\" lines=\"5\" clef.shape=\"G\" clef.line=\"2\" \/> <\/staffGrp> <\/scoreDef> <section> <?edit-start?> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"maxima\" \/> <note dur=\"longa\" \/> <note dur=\"brevis\" \/> <note dur=\"semibrevis\" \/> <note dur=\"minima\" \/> <note dur=\"semiminima\" \/> <note dur=\"fusa\" \/> <note dur=\"semifusa\" \/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <rest dur=\"maxima\" \/> <rest dur=\"longa\" \/> <rest dur=\"brevis\" \/> <rest dur=\"semibrevis\" \/> <rest dur=\"minima\" \/> <rest dur=\"semiminima\" \/> <rest dur=\"fusa\" \/> <rest dur=\"semifusa\" \/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <?edit-end?> <\/section> <\/score> <\/mdiv> <\/body> <\/music> <\/mei> Normally, longa rests are vertical strokes occupying two or three spaces in the staff, depending on the mensuration.

The rules of mensural notation can require the alteration or the imperfection of a note; that is, an increase or reduction in its performed duration. In these cases, if the encoding is intended to be used for more than just graphically representing the notation, encoding only the note shape by means of the dur attribute alone is insufficient. In that case, in addition to encoding the duration sign in the dur attribute, it is recommended to encode its performed duration in the dur.quality attribute. The dur.quality attribute specifies the length of a note according to the contextual rules of mensural notation. Its values, listed below, are adopted from the original Latin terms: perfecta Three times the duration of the note in the next smaller degree imperfecta Two times the duration of the note in the next smaller degree altera Twice the original duration of the note (only usable in perfect mensurations) minor Category of a regular semibrevis in Ars antiqua, equivalent to a third of a brevis maior Category of an altered semibrevis in Ars antiqua, equivalent to two minor semibrevis duplex One of the three categories of a longa in Ars antiqua ('duplex', 'perfecta', and 'imperfecta') The last three values are to be used exclusively in Ars antiqua mensural notation, where maior and minor refer to types of semibreves , and duplex refers to a type of longa . Examples of each of these six values are presented below.

In this case, the longas are perfect, just as the mensuration ( perfect modus minor ) indicates. Therefore, the dur.quality attribute can be omitted for the two longas .

In the Ars nova , principles of imperfection and alteration were extended into the other note levels ( brevis - semibrevis and semibrevis - minima ). This means that the breves in Ars antiqua do not have a \"perfecta\" \/ \"imperfecta\" quality, and this is why there is no dur.quality attribute for the breves in the previous example. However, the brevis can have a ternary division (indicated by tempus =\"3\"), being divided either into three (equal) minor semibreves or into a minor - maior pair of semibreves . The encoding also allows for the possibility of encoding a binary division of the breve in Ars antiqua notations: the indication tempus =\"2\" indicates the breve is divided into two equal semibreves . This is why in this example with tempus =\"3\", the semibreves do have a dur.quality attribute (with values minor or maior ). An alternative encoding---removing the dur.quality attributes for notes which lengths are not modified from their default values ( i.e. , the perfect long and the minor semibreves )---would be: Encoding of the ars antiqua related values for perfect modus (see example above) <!-- mensuration encoded in <staffDef> element indicates @modusminor = 3 and @tempus = 3 --> <layer> <note dur=\"longa\"\/> <note dur=\"semibrevis\"\/> <note dur=\"semibrevis\"\/> <note dur=\"semibrevis\"\/> <dot form=\"div\"\/> <note dur=\"semibrevis\"\/> <note dur=\"semibrevis\" dur.quality=\"maior\"\/> <note dur=\"brevis\"\/> <note dur=\"longa\" dur.quality=\"duplex\"\/> <\/layer> The conjunct use of the dur and dur.quality attributes is generally enough to encode the duration of a note—and, as indicated before, one could even remove dur.quality when its value is in agreement with the mensuration. However, there are cases ( e.g. , partial imperfection) where the values of dur.quality are not enough to provide the note’s duration.","url":"content\/mensural.html#mensuralRules","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"5.1.1 Partial Imperfection","desc":"","remarks":"In opposition to regular imperfection, which is caused by a note of the next smaller degree ( e.g. , a perfect brevis imperfected by a following\/preceding semibrevis ), partial imperfection is caused by a note of two or even three orders apart. As an example, consider an imperfect longa made up of two perfect breves . This longa can be ‘partially imperfected’ by a following\/preceding semibrevis . This semibrevis causes part of the longa —one of its perfect breves —to be imperfected, taking away one-third of one of its two halves. In this case, the longa ’s value changes from 6 semibreves (two perfect breves ) into 5 semibreves . Partial imperfection is not supported by the dur.quality attribute—because there can be many cases of partial imperfection, as will be seen in the following examples. To encode a partial imperfection, the num and numbase pair of attributes are used instead. Given the change in the longa ’s value from 6 semibreves to 5 semibreves , the corresponding attributes to encode this particular case of partial imperfection would be num =\"6\" and numbase =\"5\" as shown below in the code snippet and its rendering.

Most neume notation is used to set music to an existing text. The syllable is the fundamental unit of structure, with the neumes themselves serving as a means of “sonifying” the text. A syllable may be expressed via one or more neumes, with the particular neume shape chosen depending on the pitch contour that is being employed and the desired interpretation. The `syllable` element is used as the primary organizational element for neume notation within a `layer` element. Within `syllable`, the `syl` element defined in the `MEI.shared` module is used for encoding the textual content, while the `neume` and `nc` elements are used to encode the neumes themselves.

MEI was chosen as the basic representation format after a comparison of existing music encoding formats . The initial work on this module was performed by Gregor Schräder (Ein XML-Datenformat zur Repräsentation kritischer Musikedition unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von Neumennotation) , supervised by Prof. Stefan Morent. Since 2012 a group of scholars has been working on the development of a new version of the MEI schema for neume notations (Ichiro Fujinaga, Jennifer Bain, Debra Lacoste, Kate Helsen, and Inga Behrendt). Afterwards, other chant scholars joined the group bringing further expertise on other kinds of early music notations (namely Elsa De Luca , Alessandra Ignesti, and Sarah A. Long).","url":"content\/neumes.html#neumesBackground","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"6.1 Neume Notation and MEI","desc":" quilisma","remarks":"There are four main challenges in encoding Western European early music. The first relates to the fact that early notation was just a mnemonic aid that helped the readers to recall the music they already knew by heart and, as such, it conveys only partial musical information (Bain, Behrendt, & Helsen 2014; Helsen, Behrendt, & Bain 2017). Indeed, it is only with the invention of staff lines in the eleventh century that the system of musical transmission gradually changed, relying more on the written record rather than on orality. The second challenge refers to the existence of different regional styles of early notation; early-music manuscripts display a great graphical variety of musical signs, which include both neumes and other notational elements conveying further musical information ( e.g. , significative letters, Old Hispanic ticks, etc.). Thirdly, some of those regional notational styles occasionally share graphically similar shapes; these similar shapes within the different notational styles are understood by modern scholars to represent the same, a similar, or even a different musical meaning. Finally, while on occasion the neume shapes appear to mirror graphically the musical characteristics of the sound being represented ( e.g. , pen-stroke going up = rising melody), in many instances it is generally understood that the meaning attached to the neumes (or the other notational elements) may not be so straight-forward, but instead was ruled by conventions shared by the people who knew orally the musical repertory being fixed in written form by means of notation. What do these challenges entail for modern encoders? Firstly, sometimes we have to deal with written signs whose meaning is obscure to us and, while we can infer the meaning of some of those signs from the study of later manuscripts with the same melodies and a more precise notation, in other cases we need to turn to music palaeographers who examine the recurrence of those written signs and the context where they were used. By analysing scribal hands in particular manuscripts, palaeographers can often work out if a written sign is a meaningless scribal variant or a graphical feature conveying musical meaning to the medieval reader. Secondly, since a neume shape could either mirror on the page the aural event or bear some other musical meaning attached by convention, the encoding sometimes relies on the visual level or on the semantic level, and this distinction has to be made on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, since the same written sign could have multiple interpretations according to the style of notation where it was employed, it is crucial to be aware of the conventions of each regional notational alphabet in order to capture the musical information conveyed by that sign in the contexts where it is found. See two examples of shapes found in different regional styles that are not captured with the same encoding: Example 1 St Gall notation Oriscus (one-note ornamental neume). The oriscus is the middle note of a three-note raising gesture (commonly called salicus in the literature). <neume> <nc> <oriscus\/> <\/nc> <nc tilt=\"ne\" intm=\"u\"\/> <\/neume> Old Hispanic notation : Two-note downward melodic gesture. <neume> <nc tilt=\"ne\"\/> <nc curve=\"c\" tilt=\"s\" intm=\"d\"\/> <\/neume> Example 2 Old Hispanic notation: Four-note neutral-low-high-low melodic gesture. <neume> <nc tilt=\"ne\"\/> <nc tilt=\"se\" intm=\"d\"\/> <nc tilt=\"ne\" intm=\"u\"\/> <nc tilt=\"se\" intm=\"d\"\/> <\/neume> Aquitanian notation: Three-note rising neume with oriscus on the second note. <neume> <nc> <oriscus\/> <\/nc> <nc tilt=\"ne\" intm=\"u\"\/> <\/neume> A further complication is that while the music encoding aims to narrow down and capture the meaning of the neumes in a logical and coherent system, occasionally the significance of some neumes is under debate ( e.g. , quilisma ) and, despite its aim for accuracy, the encoding must remain open for future interpretations. From all these challenges has arisen the need for an early music encoding standardisation, that is, a set of rules that work for the description of any neume across all early notations regardless of the different methodologies applied to the study of individual notations and their idiosyncrasies. Broadly speaking, Western early notations belong to two main categories. On one side we have notations where two or more notes were represented by a single pen-stroke, while on the other side there are notations where the notes are graphically separated by means of discrete dots or short pen-strokes. These distinctions have been described even within single notational styles as gapped or not gapped (Behrendt, Bain, & Helsen 2017). To date, the MEI Neumes Module has been tested mainly on square notations and stroke notations (St. Gall, Old Hispanic, etc.), but also on Aquitanian point-notation.","url":"content\/neumes.html#neumesNotation","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"6.1 Samples of MEI encodings","desc":"","remarks":"","url":"content\/neumes.html#neumesExamples","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"6.1.1 Elements","desc":" neume nc custos episema hispanTick liquescent ncGrp oriscus quilisma signifLet strophicus syl divLine","remarks":"neume and nc are the most common elements used in the MEI Neumes module.

Guitar-like instruments can be described in terms of the number of strings they have, but often the strings are grouped and notated as if those groups were a single string. Examples include mandolins and 12-string guitars. To make this distinction explicit, we use \"string\" exclusively to refer to physical strings. To refer to the notated version, which may consist of one or more physical strings, we use the historical term, \"course\". Thus, both a 6-string and a 12-string guitar are 6-course instruments. The course tuning for 6- and 12-string guitars are the same — so they can both play from the same tablatures. Our tuning specification supports indicating course tunings on their own, or string tunings as well. The tuning element is used inside staffDef to describe the pitches of the open strings of the instrument. In the simplest cases, the tuning can be named from a standard list. For example, to specify the most common tuning of the guitar: <staffDef lines=\"6\" n=\"1\" notationtype=\"tab.guitar\"> <tuning tuning.standard=\"guitar.standard\"\/> <\/staffDef> or, for six-course lute: <staffDef lines=\"6\" n=\"1\" notationtype=\"tab.lute.french\"> <tuning tuning.standard=\"lute.renaissance.6\"\/> <\/staffDef> Custom tuning may be needed when no existing tuning.standard value applies. The course element gives the tuning of each course. n captures the course number (counting from the course closest to the player’s feet when the instrument is played), pname the pitch information and oct the octave information. For standard classical guitar tuning, the tuning element might look like this: <tuning> <course n=\"1\" pname=\"e\" oct=\"4\"\/> <course n=\"2\" pname=\"b\" oct=\"3\"\/> <course n=\"3\" pname=\"g\" oct=\"3\"\/> <course n=\"4\" pname=\"d\" oct=\"3\"\/> <course n=\"5\" pname=\"a\" oct=\"2\"\/> <course n=\"6\" pname=\"e\" oct=\"2\"\/> <\/tuning> Chromatic alteration of the open string’s pitch may be indicated by adding the accid . For example, a guitar in E-flat tuning might look like this: <staffDef lines=\"6\" n=\"1\" notationtype=\"tab.guitar\"> <tuning> <course n=\"1\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"e\" accid=\"f\"\/> <course n=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" accid=\"f\"\/> <course n=\"3\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" accid=\"f\"\/> <course n=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" accid=\"f\"\/> <course n=\"5\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"a\" accid=\"f\"\/> <course n=\"6\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\" accid=\"f\"\/> <\/tuning> <\/staffDef> Where the specific instrumental setup is important, the stringing of the instrument can also be specified. The example below is a common way to string and tune a 6-course renaissance lute. The pitch on course indicates how the resulting note would normally be transcribed in score, and would often be derived from the lowest sounding pitch. <tuning> <course n=\"1\" pname=\"g\" oct=\"4\"> <string pname=\"g\" oct=\"4\"\/> <\/course> <course n=\"2\" pname=\"d\" oct=\"4\"> <string pname=\"d\" oct=\"4\"\/> <\/course> <course n=\"3\" pname=\"a\" oct=\"3\"> <string pname=\"a\" oct=\"3\"\/> <string pname=\"a\" oct=\"3\"\/> <\/course> <course n=\"4\" pname=\"f\" oct=\"3\"> <string pname=\"f\" oct=\"4\"\/> <string pname=\"f\" oct=\"3\"\/> <\/course> <course n=\"5\" pname=\"c\" oct=\"3\"> <string pname=\"c\" oct=\"4\"\/> <string pname=\"c\" oct=\"3\"\/> <\/course> <course n=\"6\" pname=\"g\" oct=\"2\"> <string pname=\"g\" oct=\"3\"\/> <string pname=\"g\" oct=\"2\"\/> <\/course> <\/tuning>","url":"content\/tablature.html#tablature-tuning","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"7.1 Encoding Tablatures","desc":"","remarks":"","url":"content\/tablature.html#tablature-encoding","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"7.1.1 Basic Structure","desc":" note course tabGrp tabDurSym beam rest","remarks":"Unlike CMN, note elements in tablature do not have an explicit pitch, but indicate playing instructions ( i.e. , where to place fingers on the fingerboard and when to play the strings). The tab.course attribute is used to capture which course is to be struck, and tab.fret specifies on which fret of the fretboard the player should stop the course. A value of 0 for tab.fret refers to an unstopped, open course; a value of 1 refers to the first fret; and so on. Course order is the same as that given in the course elements. <note tab.course=\"6\" tab.fret=\"5\"\/> A set of vertically-aligned symbols is indicated by tabGrp , i.e. , a chord whose notes are played at the same time, and have the same (minimum) notated duration. The duration of a tabGrp may be indicated visually with a rhythm symbol, whose presence is encoded using the tabDurSym element. In many cases, the rhythm sign is omitted where it would repeat the previous value. For this reason tabDurSym is optional, and the durational value of the tabGrp is encoded as dur . <tabGrp dur=\"4\"> <tabDurSym\/> <note tab.course=\"4\" tab.fret=\"2\"\/> <note tab.course=\"6\" tab.fret=\"0\"\/> <\/tabGrp> As with CMN, rhythm flags joined together can be indicated using beam .

Vertical positioning thus does not correspond to the course to be played, and may instead reflect aesthetic or layout conventions or, in some cases, indicate voice leading. Mechanisms for encoding vertical organisation of the tablature notes in horizontal strands ( i.e. , ‘rows’ or ‘lines’) are thus required. The tab.align attribute on staffDef specifies the vertical alignment of the tablature notes. It typically takes two of the four data.VERTICALALIGNMENT values ( top and bottom ), and can be used to encode a consistent alignment of the tablature notes towards the top row or the bottom row. As with valign , top is the default value for tab.align . Therefore, in practice, tab.align is only required in the ‘bottom’ scenario. The lines attribute, also on staffDef , is used to specify the number of horizontal strands. These lines are conceptual rather than visible. Following general MEI practice, lines are counted from bottom to top, starting at 1. In specific cases, tab.anchorline is also needed on staffDef . It is used where the vertical alignment of tablature notes is consistent but cannot be identified using a typical value of tab.align ( i.e. , top or bottom ). It specifies the horizontal strand corresponding to the lines attribute on the staffDef that anchors the vertical position of notes. Note that the usage of tab.anchorline always implies top alignment (see examples below). The tab.line attribute on note , which also corresponds to the lines attribute on the staffDef , is used to indicate position of the note on one of these strands — where this deviates from the default positioning suggested by tab.align and\/or tab.anchorline . The mechanisms presented in this section may be used to encode German lute tablature according to the following four scenarios. Note that, in the encoding, the order of notes in tabGrp is significant — the first encoded note is the top symbol drawn in the chord, while the last encoded note that is a child of tabGrp is the bottom symbol in the chord.

The anchorline, usually the second line from the top or bottom, is used as the vertical starting position when stacking notes into chords. Single notes simply occupy this position; chords ‘grow upwards’ from this position. If the chord extends further than the number of available horizontal strands above the anchorline, the entire chord is shifted downward until its top note is positioned on the top-most line.

Each method may be more convenient depending on the source text and on the textual phenomena that the encoding intends to record. Both methods eventually rely on the syl element, which is part of the ‘shared’ module and is therefore available in all MEI files. The following sections will begin by introducing the general use of syl and then show in detail the two different encoding methods.","url":"content\/lyricsperfdir.html#lyricsDesc","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"8.1 Lyric Syllables","desc":" syl att.syl.log att.horizontalAlign","remarks":"By ‘lyric syllable’, these guidelines mean a word or portion of a word that is to be performed vocally. Each syllable is encoded with the syl element, with which it is also possible to specify the position of the syllable in a word, the type of connectors between syllables, alignment adjustments, and the formatting for each syllable. These are the key components: The attribute wordpos is used to specify the position of the marked-up lyric syllable in a word. It allows the following values: i Indicates that the current syllable’s position is initial; that is, at the beginning of a word; m Indicates that the current syllable is in the middle of a word; t Indicates that the syllable’s position is terminal; that is, at the end of a word. When a syllable is at the beginning or in the middle of a word (in which case it will have the wordpos attribute set to ‘i’ or ‘m’), it is recommended to specify the type of connector written between the current and the following syllable. This is expressed with the con attribute, which takes the following values: s A space is used as a connector between syllables; d A dash is used as a connector between syllables; u An underscore sign (indicating prolongation of the syllable) is used as a connector between syllables; t A tilde is used to indicate elision with the following syllable. This is typically rendered as a small curved line between the syllables. Occasionally, a word or a final syllable needs to be extended across multiple notes. In this case an ‘extender’ is provided. An extender is a continuous line drawn at the text’s baseline from the end of the syllable associated with the first note until the last note to be sung with the syllable. The use of syl described in this section is common to CMN and other notation systems, such as mensural notation. Other uses specific to certain types of notation and repertoires are addressed in other chapters. See for example .","url":"content\/lyricsperfdir.html#lyricsSyl","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"8.1 Vocally Performed Text Encoded Within Notes","desc":" note verse syl lb l","remarks":"Each lyric syllable can be encoded directly within an associated note, either by using the syl attribute on note or the verse element. Using the syl attribute on notes is the simplest way of encoding vocally performed text and is recommended only for simple situations or for those encodings which do not focus on vocally performed text. The following example from Handel’s Messiah (HWV 56) shows the use of syl : Handel, Messiah HWV 56, Hallelujah <measure> <staff> <layer> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" syl=\"Hal-\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" syl=\"le-\"\/> <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" syl=\"lu-\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" syl=\"jah,\"\/> <\/beam> <rest dur=\"4\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> When there are multiple lines of vocally performed text, or the encoder wishes to be more specific about connectors, etc., the use of verse and syl is recommended. The following example from Handel’s Messiah (HWV 56) shows the use of verse : <measure> <staff> <layer> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"> <verse n=\"1\"> <syl con=\"d\" wordpos=\"i\">Hal<\/syl> <\/verse> <\/note> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"> <verse n=\"1\"> <syl con=\"d\" wordpos=\"m\">le<\/syl> <\/verse> <\/note> <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"> <verse n=\"1\"> <syl con=\"d\" wordpos=\"m\">lu<\/syl> <\/verse> <\/note> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"> <verse n=\"1\"> <syl wordpos=\"t\">jah,<\/syl> <\/verse> <\/note> <\/beam> <rest dur=\"4\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> As it is common practice in written text, it is assumed that a space separates words. Many vocal texts, however, introduce elisions and connect two syllables into one unit. For example, the vocal text from Mozart’s Don Giovanni sung by Don Giovanni in Finale II, Ho fermo il core in petto introduces an elision between the word fermo and il and between core and in. An elision can be indicated by placing both syllables within the same note and setting the syl element’s con attribute value to 't': <note> <verse> <syl con=\"t\" wordpos=\"t\">re<\/syl> <syl wordpos=\"i\">in<\/syl> <\/verse> <\/note> When there is more than one line of text, more than one verse element can be used. The following example from a piano reduction of Wagner’s Rheingold has two lines of text, with an English translation on the second line. Note the use of the xml:lang attribute to differentiate the two languages: Example from Wagner’s Rheingold with translated text. <scoreDef> <staffGrp> <staffDef clef.line=\"4\" clef.shape=\"F\" keysig=\"4s\" lines=\"5\" n=\"1\"><\/staffDef> <\/staffGrp> <\/scoreDef> <section> <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"down\"> <verse n=\"1\" xml:lang=\"ger\"> <syl con=\"d\" wordpos=\"i\">Rei<\/syl> <\/verse> <verse n=\"2\" xml:lang=\"eng\"> <syl>thinks<\/syl> <\/verse> <\/note> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"down\"> <verse n=\"1\"> <syl wordpos=\"t\">fes<\/syl> <\/verse> <verse n=\"2\"> <syl>it<\/syl> <\/verse> <\/note> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"down\"> <verse n=\"1\"> <syl>zu<\/syl> <\/verse> <verse n=\"2\"> <syl>were<\/syl> <\/verse> <\/note> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" stem.dir=\"down\"> <verse n=\"1\"> <syl con=\"d\" wordpos=\"i\">wal<\/syl> <\/verse> <verse n=\"2\"> <syl>wise<\/syl> <\/verse> <\/note> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"d\" stem.dir=\"down\"> <accid accid=\"n\"><\/accid> <verse n=\"1\"> <syl wordpos=\"t\">ten,<\/syl> <\/verse> <verse n=\"2\"> <syl>now<\/syl> <\/verse> <\/note> <rest dur=\"4\" dur.ges=\"8p\"><\/rest> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <\/section> Optionally, it is possible to include an lb element within verse to explicitly encode line and line group beginnings.

Most of the elements described here take inspiration from encoding formats that deal primarily with text, such as HTML and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).

The div element is used to encode such structural divisions. For example, printed scores, before the actual notation, can have text that can be organized in multiple sections ( e.g. , a preface, a critical report, performance instructions, etc. for which see the following sections); each of these sections should be identified by a different div element. Text might also occur in between music sections (see ), for example in a collection of romantic piano works, a few pieces might be preceded or followed by poetry. Such text should be encoded with the div element, as demonstrated in the following example: <mdiv> <score> <section> <!-- Score of Franz Liszt's \"Sonetto 104 del Petrarca --> <\/section> <div> <!-- Text of Francesco Petrarca's Sonett n. 104. --> <lg> <l>L'aspectata vertù, che 'n voi fioriva<\/l> <l>quando Amor cominciò darvi bataglia,<\/l> <!-- ... --> <\/lg> <\/div> <\/score> <\/mdiv> Textual divisions may have titles or other forms of introductory material, which are encoded with the head element. The following example shows the encoding of a preface translated into three different languages, each with a different heading: <front> <div xml:lang=\"en\"> <head>Preface<\/head> <!-- text --> <\/div> <div xml:lang=\"de\"> <head>Vorwort<\/head> <!-- text --> <\/div> <div xml:lang=\"it\"> <head>Prefazione<\/head> <!-- text --> <\/div> <\/front> Having said that div identifies any structural organization of text, it is often helpful to distinguish the typology of division. The type attribute can be used for this purpose. type may contain any number of space-separated tags describing the nature of the div (or, in fact, any other element). The following example shows the use of type (in combination with n ) to indicate three prefaces in English, German and Italian are columns on the same page. <front> <div n=\"1\" type=\"column\" xml:lang=\"en\"> <head> Preface <\/head> <!-- text --> <\/div> <div n=\"2\" type=\"column\" xml:lang=\"de\"> <head>Vorwort<\/head> <!-- text --> <\/div> <div n=\"3\" type=\"column\" xml:lang=\"it\"> <head>Prefazione<\/head> <!-- text --> <\/div> <pb\/> <\/front>","url":"content\/textencoding.html#textDivisions","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"9.1.1 Paratext","desc":"","remarks":"This section introduces paratextual material, such as title pages, prefaces, indexes and other text that precedes or follows the actual score.","url":"content\/textencoding.html#textFrontBack","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"9.1.1.1 Front Matter","desc":" front div mdiv list ptr","remarks":"By ‘front matter’ these Guidelines mean distinct sections of a text (usually, but not necessarily, a printed one), prefixed to it by way of introduction or identification as a part of its production. The ‘front matter’ is encoded with the front element. Features such as title pages or prefaces are clear examples; a less definite case might be the prologue attached to a dramatic work. The front matter of an encoded text should not be confused with the MEI header described in chapter , which provides metadata for the entire file. An encoder may choose simply to ignore the front matter in a text, if the original presentation of the work is of no interest. No specific tags are provided for the various kinds of subdivision which may appear within front matter: instead, generic div (“division”) elements may be used, which should not be confused with mdiv (“musical division”) elements. The following suggested values for the type attribute may be used to distinguish various kinds of division characteristic of front matter: 'preface' A foreword or preface addressed to the reader in which the author or publisher explains the content, purpose, or origin of the text. 'ack' A formal declaration of acknowledgement by the author in which persons and institutions are thanked for their part in the creation of a text. 'dedication' A formal offering or dedication of a text to one or more persons or institutions by the author. 'abstract' A summary of the content of a text as continuous prose. 'contents' A table of contents, specifying the structure of a work and listing its constituents. The list element should be used to mark its structure. 'frontispiece' A pictorial frontispiece, possibly including some text. The following extended example demonstrates how various parts of the front matter of a text may be encoded. The front part begins with a title page, which is presented in section , below. This is followed by a dedication and a preface, each of which is encoded as a distinct div: <front> <titlePage> <!-- transcription of title page --> <\/titlePage> <div type=\"dedication\"> <p> <!-- Dedicatory text --> <\/p> <\/div> <div type=\"preface\"> <head> Preface <\/head> <p> <!-- paragraph 1 --> <\/p> <p> <!-- paragraph 2 --> <\/p> <!-- additional material --> <\/div> <\/front> The front matter concludes with another div element, shown in the next example, this time containing a table of contents, which contains a list element (as described in chapter ). Note the use of the ptr element to provide page-references: the implication here is that the target identifiers (song1, song2, etc.) will correspond with identifiers used for the mdiv elements containing the individual songs. (For a description of the ptr element, see chapter .) <div type=\"contents\"> <head> Contents <\/head> <list form=\"ordered\"> <li>On Wenlock Edge <ptr target=\"#song1\"\/> <\/li> <li>From Far, From Eve and Morning <ptr target=\"#song2\"\/> <\/li> <li>Is My Team Ploughing? <ptr target=\"#song3\"\/> <\/li> <li>Oh, When I Was In Love With You <ptr target=\"#song4\"\/> <\/li> <li>Bredon Hill <ptr target=\"#song5\"\/> <\/li> <li>Clun <ptr target=\"#song6\"\/> <\/li> <\/list> <\/div> Alternatively, the pointers in the table of contents might link to the page beginnings at which a song begins, assuming that these have been included in the markup: <list form=\"ordered\"> <li>On Wenlock Edge <ref target=\"#song1-p1\">1<\/ref> <\/li> <li>From Far, From Eve and Morning <ref target=\"#song2-p15\">15<\/ref> <\/li> <!-- .... --> <\/list> <!-- Later in the document --> <mdiv type=\"song\"> <pb xml:id=\"song1-p1\"\/> <!-- .... --> <\/mdiv> <mdiv type=\"song\"> <pb xml:id=\"song2-p15\"\/> <!-- .... --> <\/mdiv> <!-- .... -->","url":"content\/textencoding.html#textFront","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"9.1.1.1 Back Matter","desc":" front back","remarks":"Conventions vary as to which elements are grouped as back matter and which as front. For example, some books place the table of contents at the front, and others at the back. For this reason, the content models of the front and back elements are identical. The ‘back matter’ is encoded with the back element. The following suggested values may be used for the type attribute on all division elements, in order to distinguish various kinds of divisions characteristic of back matter: 'appendix' An ancillary self-contained section of a work, often providing additional but in some sense extra-canonical text. 'glossary' A list of terms associated with definition texts (‘glosses’). 'notes' A section in which textual notes are gathered together. 'bibliography' A list of bibliographic citations. 'index' Any form of index to the work. 'colophon' A statement appearing at the end of a book describing the conditions of its physical production. No additional elements are proposed for the encoding of back matter at present. Some characteristic examples follow; first, an index (for the case in which a printed index is of sufficient interest to merit transcription): <back> <div type=\"index\"> <head> Index <\/head> <list type=\"index\"> <li>a2, a3, etc., 175-176<\/li> <li>Abbreviations, 3 <list type=\"index\"> <li>Percussion, 205-213<\/li> <li>Strings, 307<\/li> <\/list> <\/li> <li>Afterbeats, 77<\/li> <\/list> <\/div> <\/back> Note that if the page beginnings in the original source have also been explicitly encoded, and given identifiers, the references to them in the above index can more usefully be recorded as links. For example, assuming that the encoding of page 77 of the original source starts like this: <pb xml:id=\"text.P77\"\/> then the last item above might be encoded more usefully in the following form: <li>Afterbeats, <ref target=\"#text.P77\">77<\/ref> <\/li>","url":"content\/textencoding.html#textBack","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"9.1 Text in MEI","desc":"","remarks":"This chapter describes methods for encoding textual content with MEI.

While rend is used to record relative font size and weight, absolute values for these qualities (measured in printer’s points) should be specified using the fontsize and fontweight attributes. In addition to commonly found typographical qualities, MEI provides the altrend attribute for the capture of additional, user-defined rendition information. The rend element can accept glyph.auth and glyph.uri attributes, which provide encoders with the ability to specify an external authority for Unicode codepoints in the textual content. Only the text content that should be rendered using SMuFL code points should go inside the rend element when using glyph.auth and glyph.uri . <rend> This is what a G clef looks like: <rend glyph.auth=\"smufl\">&amp;#xE050;<\/rend> <\/rend>","url":"content\/textencoding.html#sharedTextRendition","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"9.1.1 Figures","desc":" fig graphic","remarks":"The fig element groups elements representing or containing graphic information such as an illustration or figure.

It provides an extensible file format for the losslessly compressed storage of raster images. Indexed-color, grayscale, and true-color images are supported, plus an optional alpha channel. Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits. It is defined by IETF RFC 2083, March 1997. TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) Currently the most widely supported raster image format, especially for black and white images, TIFF is also one of the few formats commonly supported on more than one operating system. The drawback to TIFF is that it actually is a wrapper for several formats, and some TIFF-supporting software does not support all variants. TIFF files may use LZW, CCITT Group 4, or PackBits compression methods, or may use no compression at all. Also, TIFF files may be monochrome, greyscale, or polychromatic. All such options should be specified in prose at the end of the encodingDesc section of the MEI header for any document including TIFF images. TIFF is owned by Aldus Corporation. Documentation on TIFF is available from the owner at Craigcook Castle, Craigcook Road, Edinburgh EH4 3UH, Scotland, or 411 First Avenue South, Seattle, Washington 98104 USA. GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) Raster images are widely available in this form, which was created by CompuServe Information Services, but has by now been implemented for many other systems as well. Documentation is copyright by, and is available from, CompuServe Incorporated, Graphics Technology Department, 5000 Arlington Center Boulevard, Columbus, Ohio 43220 USA. PBM (Portable Bit Map) PBM files are easy to process, eschewing all compression in favor of transparency of file format. PBM files can, of course, be compressed by generic file-compression tools for storage and transfer. Public domain software exists which will convert many other formats to and from PBM. Documentation of PBM is copyright by Jeff Poskanzer, and is available widely on the Internet.

When tabular presentation is regarded as of less intrinsic importance, it is correspondingly simpler to encode descriptive or functional information about the contents of the table, for example to identify one cell as containing a name and another as containing a date, though the two methods may be combined. The table element may appear both within other components (such as paragraphs), or between them, provided that the module defined in this chapter has been enabled. It is to a large extent arbitrary whether a table should be regarded as a series of rows or as a series of columns. For compatibility with currently available systems, however, these Guidelines require a row-by-row description of a table.

The role attribute on persName may be used to capture a person’s responsibility. For example: <persName role=\"arranger\">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart<\/persName> <persName role=\"lyricist\">Heinrich Heine<\/persName> The Marc code list for relators offers a variety of controlled terms that may serve as values for this use of role . Personal names often consist of several components, such as given names, surnames, inherited or life-time titles of nobility, honorific or academic prefixes, military ranks, and other traditional descriptive phrases. These components can be marked using persName sub-elements, the function of which may be indicated using the type attribute with the following values: forename contains a forename surname a family (inherited) name, as opposed to a given, baptismal, or nick name rolename contains a name component which indicates that the referent has a particular role or position in society, such as an official title or rank addname (additional name) contains an additional name component, such as a nickname, epithet, or alias, or any other descriptive phrase used within a personal name namelink (name link) contains a connecting phrase or link used within a name but not regarded as part of it, such as van der or of genname (generational name) contains a name component used to distinguish otherwise similar names on the basis of the relative ages or generations of the persons named However, the recommended practice is to employ the following sub-elements provided by the namesdates module: For example, <persName> <foreName>Rob<\/foreName> <addName>The Bold<\/addName> <famName>Stark<\/famName> <genName>I<\/genName> <nameLink>of<\/nameLink> <geogName>Winterfell<\/geogName> <roleName>King in the North<\/roleName> <\/persName> In the case of individuals with more than one forename, it is often sufficient to place all given names within a single foreName element: <persName> <famName>Mozart<\/famName>, <foreName>Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus<\/foreName> <\/persName> However, the advantage of marking names with specific name part elements instead of nested persName elements, is that it becomes possible to use the type attribute to distinguish between multiple instances of the same generic name component.

For the historian a style is a distinguishing and ordering concept, both consistent of and denoting generalities; he or she groups examples of music according to similarities between them.” (Source: “Style”, Grove Music Online, accessed: April 27, 2012) The name of a musical style can be marked by the styleName element, for example: <styleName>bebop<\/styleName> It may be, e.g. , used for recording a style name within a title: <title>La voix du <styleName>bebop<\/styleName> <\/title> or to record a style of a certain epoch by using the styleName sub-element: <periodName>Modern <styleName>Jazz<\/styleName> <\/periodName> Musical forms and genres must be distinguished from musical style.

It provides a concept for categorizing musical objects (notes) and describing their relationships. It is a kind of grouping and combining, mostly developed in connection with atonal music. However, the concept of set theory is general and can also be applied to tonal music. A pitch class means the summary of every pitch with specific characteristics that means a pitch class set is an unordered collection of pitches, e.g. , every pitch with the name C. A pitch class may contain a large number of pitches, because different octaves and enharmonic spellings of pitch make no difference. The notes C, E, and G would be 0, 4 and 7 in pitch class notation, for example, regardless of the octave in which they are performed.

Where the goal is diplomatic transcription, simply recording the uninterpreted label is sufficient. Recording the precise meaning of such a label requires storing an interpretation. But, including the interpretation at every point of occurrence of the label would swell the size of the file and complicate the markup for those users who are not interested in the interpretation. Therefore, MEI separates the encoding of harmonic labels from the encoding of the interpretation of those labels. The following elements enable the creation and re-use of interpreted chord data: The chordTable element is a container for a set of chord definitions, while the chordDef element defines a single chord. Chord definitions may be created a priori or as the result of analysis of the pitch content of the music at hand, for instance, by examination of the notes occurring on the downbeat of each measure. In this way, the chord definitions serve as a record of the analysis. Even though it is not required by the schema, an xml:id attribute on chordDef is necessary to permit the creation of associations between harmonic indications in the musical text with the chord defined here. The xml:id attribute provides a unique identifier for the chord definition that can be referenced by the harm element’s chordref attribute. Individual pitches of a chord are encoded using chordMember . The inth attribute provides the means for indicating the number of half steps of the chord note above the bass note. These simple resources allow for the detailed specification and interpretation of harmonic indications found in the musical text. For example, the harmonic label A can be equated with a fully spelled-out indication of functional harmony that can be substituted for the harmonic label, say, in an aural rendition: <!-- Chord defined in scoreDef --><chordDef xml:id=\"harmonychordA\"> <chordMember oct=\"2\" pname=\"a\"><\/chordMember> <chordMember oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\"><\/chordMember> <chordMember accid.ges=\"s\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"><\/chordMember> <chordMember oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"><\/chordMember> <chordMember oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"><\/chordMember> <\/chordDef> <!-- Later in musical text --> <harm chordref=\"#harmonychordA\" tstamp=\"1\">A<\/harm> Alternatively, the non-bass chord tones may be indicated, not with pitch names, but with their intervallic distance above the bass note.

For more generic uses, however, the encoding can be taken one step further; that is, it can be reduced to its minimum intervallic content by eliminating octave duplications and expressing all chord members, including the bass note, using intervals above the bass. Of course, the inth attribute for the bass note itself should be set to P1.

This is probably how an OMR program or other naive encoder might deal with the markup of figured bass: Figured bass <harm place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\">6<\/harm> However, this kind of approach fails to recognize that a figured bass is being used and not some other system of harmonic indications. To capture this knowledge, the preceding example can also be marked more explicitly with: <harm place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"> <fb> <f>6<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> In order to provide greater control over the individual components of the figured bass, each component can be treated as a figure.

In the preceding example, the entire figured bass sign is encoded from top to bottom, in other words, just as the figure appears on the page. In the following examples, the encoding order of the characters in f explicitly locates the accidentals: Figured bass with chromatically altered figure <harm place=\"below\"> <fb> <f>7♭<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> Figured bass with chromatically altered figures <harm> <fb> <f>6<\/f> <f>4+<\/f> <f>♮3<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> You may use 6\\ and 6\/ for numerals that should be shown with a backslash and slash, respectively.

The altsym attribute can be used to point to a user-defined symbol that better represents the figure component, for example, the combined \"2\" and \"+\" below. Similar to the slash in the preceding example before, the small curve over the \"5\" in example 6 can be represented by the Unicode COMBINING INVERTED BREVE. Figured bass with alternative sign <measure> <harm tstamp=\"1\"> <fb> <f>̑<\/f> <f extender=\"true\">5<\/f> <f altsym=\"combo2plus\">2+<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> <harm tstamp=\"3\"> <fb> <f>3<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> <\/measure> Because the repertoire of signs is so large, figures which consist entirely of a mark indicating repetition of the preceding figure, should be represented by the character appearing in the document. For example, in some notational styles, the repetition sign is a dash (-), while in others it is a solidus (\/). Using characters like this is also consistent with other existing figured bass encoding schemes. Figured bass repetition <harm tstamp=\"1.5\"> <fb> <f>-<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> Often, the distinction between extending lines and repetition signs is unclear. Treating what at first appear to be extenders as repetition signs, however, can sometimes help to simplify the required markup and to make the intent of the signs explicit. For example, in the following example the dashes on beat 4 and 4.5 are treated as repetition signs: Extenders and repetition <measure> <harm tstamp=\"3.5\"> <fb> <f>♭3<\/f> <f>6<\/f> <f>5<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> <harm tstamp=\"4\"> <fb> <f>-<\/f> <f>♯3<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> <harm tstamp=\"4.5\"> <fb> <f>7<\/f> <f>-<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> <\/measure> Using extender attributes for this example may make it easier to render the figured bass symbol, but it is less explicit with regard to the intended harmony. For example, it is difficult to ascertain what harmony should be sounding on beat 4 and its after-beat. <measure> <harm tstamp=\"3.5\"> <fb> <f>♭3<\/f> <f extender=\"true\">6<\/f> <f>5<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> <harm tstamp=\"4\"> <fb> <f extender=\"true\">♯3<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> <harm tstamp=\"4.5\"> <fb> <f>7<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> <\/measure> The primary goal of fb is not the capture all the visual idiosyncracies that can be found in printed and manuscript scores throughout the centuries, but to provide a more-or-less standardized label. The markup below, or any markup in fact, cannot capture the exact look of the figured bass signs. The altsym attribute may be used to provide access to a user-defined symbol for precise rendition. Similarly, the facs attribute may be employed to point to the symbol as it occurs in the encoding source material. Figured bass with alternative sign <!-- Ex. a --><measure> <harm tstamp=\"3\"> <fb> <f>8<\/f> <f altsym=\"#my6_1\" facs=\"#source6_1\">6♮<\/f> <f>4+<\/f> <f>2<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> <harm tstamp=\"4\"> <fb> <f altsym=\"#my6_2\" facs=\"#source6_2\">6\\<\/f> <f>4<\/f> <f>3<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> <\/measure> <!-- Ex. b --><harm tstamp=\"4.5\"> <fb> <f>6\\<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> <!-- Ex. c --><harm tstamp=\"1\"> <fb> <f>5\/<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm> <!-- Ex. d --><harm> <fb> <f altsym=\"#my5\" facs=\"#source5\">5+<\/f> <\/fb> <\/harm>","url":"content\/analysisharm.html#harmonyFigbass","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"B11 Scholarly Editing with MEI","desc":"","remarks":"This chapter introduces markup targeting at digital scholarly editions of music.

Therefore, it must contain at least two child elements. Possible child elements are lem and rdg , which use the same model, but have a different meaning: Whereas lem is used for prioritizing one alternative, a rdg has no such additional meaning and simply indicates a reading as found in one or more sources. Accordingly, lem is allowed only once in app , whereas rdg may appear as often as necessary. <app> <lem> <!-- preferred reading --> <\/lem> <rdg> <!-- alternative reading --> <\/rdg> <rdg> <!-- alternative reading --> <\/rdg> <\/app> The rdg (and lem ) elements use the source attribute to point to one or more descriptions of the bibliographic sources containing the material they mark: <!-- In the document content: --><app> <rdg source=\"#critApp.source1\"> <!-- reading of source 1 --> <\/rdg> <rdg source=\"#critApp.source2 #critApp.source3\"> <!-- reading of sources 2 *and* 3 --> <\/rdg> <\/app> <!-- Earlier in the document header: --><sourceDesc> <source xml:id=\"critApp.source1\"> <!-- bibliographic description of source 1 --> <\/source> <source xml:id=\"critApp.source2\"> <!-- bibliographic description of source 2 --> <\/source> <source xml:id=\"critApp.source3\"> <!-- bibliographic description of source 3 --> <\/source> <\/sourceDesc> The seq attribute may be used on lem or rdg to record the sequence of a series of readings. In the following example, the material in source B is marked as sequential to (and perhaps derived from) the reading in source A: <app> <rdg seq=\"1\" source=\"#critApp.sourceA\"> <!-- material in source 1 --> <\/rdg> <rdg seq=\"2\" source=\"#critApp.sourceB\"> <!-- material in source 2 --> <\/rdg> <\/app> If interested in modeling such dependencies between witnesses, using markup from is generally recommendable. If a source has additional content that is not found in other sources, an empty rdg element may be used to indicate the lack of material in the other sources. In the following example, source 1 includes material that is not found in sources 2 and 3: <app> <rdg source=\"#critApp.source1\"> <!-- additional content of source 1 --> <\/rdg> <rdg source=\"#critApp.source2 #critApp.source3\"\/> <\/app> When working with a large number of sources, it might seem tedious to provide references for all sources.

An example of this is two sources that have the same content, but a different ordering of staves on which the content is written. By definition, the order of staves in MEI is described in and derived from the order of staffDef elements in scoreDef , not from the order of staff elements within a measure . The staff element in a measure points to its corresponding staffDef using the same value for n on both elements. This rather loose mechanism makes it possible to point dynamically to the correct staff definition for a given source. The following example demonstrates how this can be accomplished for two sources, both presenting a two-staff score, but with differing staff order. No further app element is necessary within the measure to describe the alternative score order of the sources. <score> <app> <rdg source=\"#critApp.source1\"> <scoreDef> <staffGrp> <staffDef n=\"1\"\/> <staffDef n=\"2\"\/> <\/staffGrp> <\/scoreDef> <\/rdg> <rdg source=\"#critApp.source2\"> <scoreDef> <staffGrp> <!-- The order of <staffDef> elements defines score order, not its @n attribute! --> <staffDef n=\"2\"\/> <staffDef n=\"1\"\/> <\/staffGrp> <\/scoreDef> <\/rdg> <\/app> <section> <measure> <staff n=\"1\">…<\/staff> <staff n=\"2\">…<\/staff> <\/measure> <\/section> <\/score> When unique values for n on layerDef and layer are provided, it is possible to reallocate layers in the same fashion as staves. This mechanism may also be used to describe not only differing page orientations, formats and margins, but also clefs and keys. The use of app in conjunction with staffDef illustrates the greater flexibility of connecting staff and staffDef by a shared n value. A technically more robust alternative to n would be to use the def attribute on staff , which points to the xml:id of a staffDef . However, this strong connection would be tied to one specific staffDef , and would not allow to pick one alternative out of an app .","url":"content\/scholarlyediting.html#critAppInDefs","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"11.1.1 Nesting Apparati","desc":" app rdg","remarks":"In some situations, musical sources will agree at one level while differing at a lower level.

The elements and attributes described in this chapter may be used to record such editorial interventions, whether made by the composer, the copyists of the manuscript, the editor of an earlier edition used as a copy text, or the current encoder\/editor. The scope of the elements described herein is therefore the description of features relating to the genesis, later revision and editorial interpretation of a text. Mechanisms for describing multiple sources are described in chapter of these Guidelines, while the full setup for genetic editions is described in chapter . The elements described in this chapter may be contained by a wide range of other MEI elements and, in turn, may contain a variety of elements. The encoder must assume responsibility for the appropriateness of the markup; that is, a great many combinations of editorial and transcriptional markup are technically possible, but care must be taken to see that the encoding does not contravene the rationale of these Guidelines. In general, it should be ensured that a file would be valid if the editorial markup would be omitted, as such a validation cannot be ensured in an efficient way by the MEI schema. For most of the elements discussed here, some encoders may wish to indicate both a responsibility; that is, a coded value indicating the person or agency responsible for making the editorial intervention in question, and an indication of the degree of certainty which the encoder wishes to associate with the intervention. The elements discussed here thus may potentially carry the following optional attributes: They are available through the generic attribute class att.common , which is a member of att.responsibility , and the attribute class att.edit , to which these elements subscribe. Many of the elements discussed here can be used in two ways. Their primary purpose is to indicate that their content represents an editorial intervention (or, in some cases, the lack of intervention) of a specific kind. Sometimes, pairs or other meaningful groupings of such elements can be recorded, then wrapped within the special purpose choice element: Wrapping elements this way enables the encoder to represent, for example, a text in its ‘original’, uncorrected form alongside the same text in one or more ‘edited’ forms. Making use of this style of representation, software may dynamically switch between the ‘Urtext view’ of the text and one or more ‘views’ of the text after the application of the encoded editorial interventions. Elements which can be combined in this way constitute the model.choicePart class. The default members of this class are sic , corr , reg , orig , and unclear . As model.editLike and model.editorialLike are members of model.choicePart , choice , subst , abbr , and expan can also be combined with the other elements. All of their functions and usage are described in greater detail below. Three categories of editorial intervention are discussed by the remainder of this chapter: indication or correction of apparent errors; indication of regularization of variant, irregular, non-standard, or eccentric forms; and editorial additions, suppressions, and omissions.","url":"content\/scholarlyediting.html#editTrans","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"11.1.1 Abbreviations","desc":" expan expansion abbr choice","remarks":"MEI offers methods for marking abbreviations in prose, as in the following example: <p> ... the next passage shall be performed in<abbr>pno:<\/abbr>... <\/p> or abbreviations in the music itself, as in the following example: <abbr> <bTrem unitdur=\"16\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.mod=\"2slash\"\/> <\/bTrem> <\/abbr> The generic type attribute may be used to classify the abbreviation according to a convenient typology. Sample values include: suspension the abbreviation provides the first letter(s) of the word or phrase, omitting the remainder; contraction the abbreviation omits some letter(s) in the middle; brevigraph the abbreviation comprises a special symbol or mark; superscription the abbreviation includes writing above the line; acronym the abbreviation comprises the initial letters of the words of a phrase; title the abbreviation is for a title of address (Dr, Ms, Mr, ...); organization the abbreviation is for the name of an organization; geographic the abbreviation is for a geographic name. This tag is the mirror image of the expan tag (not to be confused with the expansion element described in ). Both abbr and expan allow the encoder to transcribe an abbreviation and its expansion. In the case of abbr , the original is transcribed as the content of the element and the expansion as an attribute value, while expan reverses this. The choice between the two is up to the user. For example: <div> <!-- using abbr --> <p> … the next passage shall be performed in<abbr expan=\"piano\">pno:<\/abbr>… <\/p> <!-- using expan --> <p>… the next passage shall be performed in <expan abbr=\"pno:\">piano<\/expan>… <\/p> <\/div> The abbr tag is not required; if appropriate, the encoder may transcribe abbreviations in the source text silently, without tagging them. If abbreviations are not transcribed directly but expanded silently, then the MEI header should indicate this is the case. The cert attribute signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the expansion of the abbreviation. The expan attribute gives an expansion of the abbreviation. The resp attribute contains an ID reference to an element containing the name of the editor or transcriber responsible for supplying the expansion of the abbreviation. When the content of the abbr or expan attributes requires additional markup, an attribute cannot be used. In this case, the abbreviated and expanded forms must be presented within elements. Furthermore, as alternatives to each other, the abbr and expan elements must be wrapped by the choice element, as described above. The previous example, where the 'o:' in 'pno:' is written as superscript, would be encoded as: <p>… the next passage shall be performed in <choice> <abbr>pn<rend rend=\"sup\">o:<\/rend> <\/abbr> <expan>piano<\/expan> <\/choice> <\/p>","url":"content\/scholarlyediting.html#edittransAbbrev","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"11.1.1.1 Instructions","desc":" mRpt beatRpt halfmRpt mRpt2 multiRpt cpMark space mSpace choice abbr expan","remarks":"Many musical scores make use of various kinds of shorthand notation which omit some parts of the score that have already been written elsewhere. Typical examples for this are symbols that indicate repetition of the preceding measure or beat. In MEI, these symbols can be encoded using the mRpt and beatRpt elements respectively. Often, similar graphical symbols (often one or two slashes, \"\/\/\") are used to mean that the current staff should have the same or similar content as another staff. colla parte directives have a less strictly-defined scope than the ‘Rpt elements’ ( beatRpt , halfmRpt , mRpt , mRpt2 , multiRpt ). That is, rather than specifying the repetition of content of a particular duration, like a measure or beat, colla parte instructions can refer to material of any length. In order to encode such scribal shorthand, MEI offers the cpMark element, which allows filling of blank spaces in the score with horizontally and\/or vertically distant material. Like any other ‘controlEvent’ (see ), cpMark is placed in the score using the staff and tstamp attributes. The end point of the mark itself, when necessary, may be indicated using the tstamp2 attribute. The source material, which is intended to be inserted in the space indicated by the copy mark, can be identified by the attributes origin.tstamp , origin.tstamp2 , origin.staff and origin.layer . While origin.tstamp provides the relative distance from the beginning of the \"gap\", origin.tstamp is relative to the position identified by origin.tstamp . However, origin.tstamp defaults to the same value as tstamp2 and should only be provided when necessary. When neither origin.staff nor origin.tstamp are provided, they take the same values as the cpMark’s staff and tstamp attributes; that is, they indicate a strict ‘vertical’ or ‘horizontal’ copy. Copy marks in the first and second violin of C.M.v.Weber’s Freischütz, Autograph, Nr.3 (Walzer), measures 223-231 In the example above, there are no less than three different copy instructions, which need to be encoded with four cpMark elements. First, Weber inserts characters from \"a\" to \"f\" in red ink to identify filled measures. Then, he repeats the same characters in empty measures, which indicates that the content from the filled measures should be copied here. While one could try to encode this with just one cpMark element, it is both clearer and easier to process when using two elements. The second and third shorthand indications are written in the second violin (lower staff). Here, Weber writes \"unis.[ono]\", silently omitting the reference to the first violin. His next shorthand (\"in 8va\") additionally instructs the copyist to double the written material in another octave. This information can be captured using the dis and dis.place attributes on cpMark . <cpMark origin.tstamp=\"-6m+1\" staff=\"8\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"5m+4\">a. b. c. d. e. f. g.<\/cpMark> <cpMark origin.tstamp=\"-6m+1\" staff=\"9\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"5m+4\">a. b. c. d. e. f. g.<\/cpMark> <cpMark origin.staff=\"8\" staff=\"9\" tstamp=\"1.5\" tstamp2=\"1m+3.5\">unis:<\/cpMark> <cpMark dis=\"8\" dis.place=\"below\" origin.staff=\"8\" staff=\"9\" tstamp=\"2\" tstamp2=\"2m+3.5\">in 8va<\/cpMark> A transcription of the example above with all shorthand resolved and colored Text used as a copy mark, like the letters in the Weber example, may be encoded as content of the cpMark element. In the case of non-text marks, the altsym and facs attributes may be used to refer to a graphical surrogate. Depending on the purpose of the encoding, the omitted parts in the score may be filled with space and mSpace elements of appropriate duration or silently overwritten with the content that the cpMark identifies. Also, these two options may be combined through the use a choice element whose abbr and expan children explicitly encode a transcription of the original ‘gap’ (in abbr) and the result of the insertion of the indicated material (in expan, see ).","url":"content\/scholarlyediting.html#edittranscpMark","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"11.1.1 Apparent Errors","desc":" sic corr choice name add del supplied expan","remarks":"When the source material to be encoded is manifestly faulty, an encoder or transcriber may elect simply to correct it without comment, although for scholarly purposes it will often be more generally useful to record both the correction and the original state of the text. The elements described here enable all three approaches, and allows the last to be done in a way that makes it easy for software to present either the original or the correction. The following examples show alternative treatment of the same material. The text to be encoded contains a chord (c4, e4, g4, a4), where c4, e4, and a4 are quarter notes, but g4 is incorrectly written as a half note. An encoder may choose to silently correct the engraver’s error: <chord> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"\/> <\/chord> or the correction may be made explicit: <chord> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"\/> <corr> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <\/corr> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"\/> <\/chord> Alternatively, the encoder may simply record the typographic error without correcting it, either without comment or with a sic element to indicate the error is not a transcription error in the encoding: <chord> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"\/> <sic> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <\/sic> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"\/> <\/chord> If the encoder elects to record the original source text and provide a correction for the sake of transparency, both sic and corr may be used, wrapped in a choice element.

Its value ( #editTrans.JK ) is an example of the pointer values discussed in section . In this case, the resp attribute points to a name element within the metadata header, but any element might be indicated in this way, if the correction has been taken from some other source. The resp attribute is available for all elements which are members of the att.common class (through att.responsibility ). The att.edit class makes available a cert attribute (through att.evidence ), which may be used to indicate the degree of editorial confidence in a particular correction, as in the following example: <chord> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"\/> <choice> <sic> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <\/sic> <corr cert=\"high\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <\/corr> <\/choice> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\"\/> <\/chord> Where, as here, the correction takes the form of amending information present in the text being encoded, the encoder should use the corr element.

For additional information on the use of add and del , see section . Where the correction takes the form of an addition of material not present in the original because of physical damage or illegibility, the supplied element may be used.

Each place in the text at which omission has taken place should be marked with a gap element, optionally with further information about the reason for the omission, its extent, and the person or agency responsible for it, as in the following examples: <gap extent=\"2\" reason=\"illegible\" unit=\"quarter_note\"\/> <gap extent=\"several notes\" reason=\"overwriting illegible\"\/> Note that the extent of the gap may be marked precisely using attributes unit and extent . Unlike TEI, MEI does not offer a desc element for further description of the reason for a gap. Instead, an annot may refer to the gap via its startid , endid , or plist attributes and provide additional information. The unclear element is used to mark passages in the original which cannot be read with confidence, or about which the transcriber is uncertain for other reasons, as for example when transcribing an illegible source.

When the reason for a gap in the encoding is damage of the document carrier (the paper on which the document is written, for example), the damage element should be used instead of the gap element. In the case of damage resulting from an identifiable cause, the agent attribute signifies the causative agent. The degree attribute signifies the degree of damage according to a convenient scale. A damage tag with this attribute should only be used where the text may be read with some confidence; data supplied from other sources should be tagged as supplied . The extent attribute indicates approximately how much text is in the damaged area, in notes, measures, inches, or any appropriate unit, where this cannot be deduced from the contents of the tag. For example, the damage may span structural divisions in the text so that the tag must then be empty of content. In the case of damage (deliberate defacement, etc.) assignable to an identifiable hand, the hand attribute signifies the hand responsible for the damage. Sometimes the editor provides information not present in the source material. These conjectures or emendations are marked up in MEI using the supplied element. The following example demonstrates the use of the supplied element in combination with gap within subst : <beam> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"d\"\/> <subst> <gap extent=\"two eighth notes\" reason=\"missing notes\"\/> <supplied> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\"\/> <\/supplied> <\/subst> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"a\"\/> <\/beam> When the presumed loss of text arises from an identifiable cause, agent signifies the causative agent. When the presumed loss of text arises from action (partial deletion, etc.) assignable to an identifiable hand, the hand attribute signifies the hand responsible for the action. The reason attribute indicates why the text has to be supplied, e.g. , 'overbinding', 'faded ink', 'lost folio', 'omitted in original', etc. The source attribute contains the source of the supplied text. The editor(s) responsible for supplied material may be recorded in the resp attribute. The value of resp must point to one or more identifiers declared in the document header. The cert attribute signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the supplied material.","url":"content\/scholarlyediting.html#edittransOmission","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"11.1.1.1 Visual appearance of editorial decisions","desc":" supplied","remarks":"Material added by the editors is often highlighted in the sheet music, either by brackets or small print.

For this purpose MEI offers the restore element, which may contain a del or other content directly. The following example illustrates an instance where a lyric was cancelled and later restored by overwriting it: <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"> <syl> <restore desc=\"overwritten\"> <del>God<\/del> <\/restore> <\/syl> <\/note> The desc attribute gives a prose description of the means of restoration. The cert attribute signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the identification of the hand of the restoration. The type attribute may be used to indicate the action cancelled by the restoration. The resp attribute contains an ID reference to an element containing the name of the editor or transcriber responsible for identifying the hand of the restoration. The hand attribute signifies the hand of the agent which made the restoration. MEI offers a handShift milestone element that can be used to mark a change of scribe or scribal style. The character attribute describes characteristics of the hand, particularly those related to the quality of the writing, e.g. , 'shaky', 'thick', regular'. A description of the tint or type of ink, e.g. , 'brown' or the writing medium, e.g. , 'pencil', may be placed in the medium attribute. <layer> <note pname=\"f\"\/> <note pname=\"a\"\/> <handShift medium=\"blue ink\"\/> <note pname=\"c\"\/> <note pname=\"e\"\/> <\/layer> The new hand may be identified using the new attribute, while the previous hand may be recorded in the old attribute.

The aim of genetic textual criticism is to investigate compositional working and thinking processes - the genesis of compositions. In contrast to traditional scholarly editions, which focus on the constitution of a performable text of a work, Genetic Textual Criticism focuses on the process of production, the gradual elaboration of musical thoughts while writing. It is dependent on the availability of comprehensible traces of these writing processes. Genetic editions often have to deal with significant uncertainties, and they require a considerable amount of markup, as detailed below.","url":"content\/scholarlyediting.html#genetic","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"11.1.1 Encoding Genetic States","desc":" genDesc music genState desc date respStmt","remarks":"Leaving aside temporary breaks, a compositional process is continuous: the composer’s writing operations have happened in a strict order, which could be specified if his working would have been filmed. However, this exact order is rarely ever recoverable from the surviving manuscripts, prints or other materials. Instead, relative statements can be made – the red pencil must have been written after the brown ink etc. Instead of a continuous movie, scholars are often only able to reconstruct a slide show, reflecting certain recoverable states of the composition. Very often, those states have a local range only – the order of two states on one page may be known, as is the order of two other states on a second page. This doesn't necessarily allow to identify the succession of all four states. MEI utilizes the genDesc element to describe the recoverable genetic states of a work. It is nested inside music and may contain a number of genState elements. A genetic description is used to bundle all known states of a work. The ordered attribute may be used to specify whether the order of child elements of the genDesc matches their temporal order, or if their temporal order is unknown. As genDesc may be self-nested, it is possible to specify the order of some states within a larger unordered set of genetic states, or to position a set of states with unknown temporal order in a larger ordered set. <genDesc ordered=\"false\"> <genState label=\"State A\"\/> <genState label=\"State B\"\/> <genDesc ordered=\"true\"> <genState label=\"State C1\"\/> <genState label=\"State C2\"\/> <genState label=\"State C3\"\/> <\/genDesc> <\/genDesc> In the above example, the temporal relation of states A, B and all of C is not known, but it is known that C1 precedes C2 and C3. Even when the temporal order of a set of states is not fully recoverable, some arguments about relative chronology may be available. It is possible to encode these statements with the precision the editor feels comfortable with, utilizing the attributes next and prev (for immediate successors \/ predecessors), and precedes and follows (for relative successors \/ predecessors). Genetic states can be further described by using any combination of the desc , date , and respStmt children of genState .","url":"content\/scholarlyediting.html#geneticStates","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"11.1.1 Referencing Genetic States","desc":" genDesc add del genState","remarks":"While the (relative) chronology of genetic states may be encoded using the genDesc element (see ), the textual operations they manifest in are encoded using the regular add , del , etc. elements are used (see ). However, for a genetic edition these elements are linked to their corresponding genState element using the state attribute. <!-- definition of a state within genDesc --> <genState xml:id=\"genetic.stateX\"\/> <!-- somewhere later in the musical text: --> <subst state=\"#genetic.stateX\"> <del> <clef shape=\"C\" line=\"1\"\/> <\/del> <add> <clef shape=\"G\" line=\"2\"\/> <\/add> <\/subst> In the example above, state X of the encoded work is established by the change from a C clef to a G clef. Other states preceding state X will read a C clef, while state X and succeeding states read a G clef. A genetic state of the work is constituted by performing all textual operations referencing that state, i.e. , by carrying out all additions, deletions and restorations. The instant attribute on del etc. allows to specify that corresponding modification has been carried out immediately after writing the original text, so that no separate genetic state has been established. It is up to encoder to identify the appropriate level of granularity: In an ideal world, the writing or cancellation of a single note would constitute a new state. In practice, this level of detail isn't feasible, and the combination of multiple writing operations into larger logical operations seems inevitable. However, this may range from very large tasks (‘replacing the second movement of a symphony’) to very small ones (‘adding the slurs for the viola in measures 22 and 23’), depending on the intentions and scope of the encoding.","url":"content\/scholarlyediting.html#geneticReferences","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"11.1.1 Encoding Metatexts","desc":" metaMark measure restore","remarks":"The arguments used to establish a chronological order of genetic states are sometimes found in external sources like letters, but very often they are to be found in the witnesses holding the musical text, even though they are typically not part of the text itself. Examples for such arguments are the writing medium, spacing, marginal notes, among others. Some of these so-called ‘metatexts’ can be encoded using MEI, namely those that are written into the relevant sources. For this purpose, MEI offers the metaMark element, as known from the TEI. A metaMark is provided as a ‘controlEvent’ (see ); as such, by convention, it should be encoded at the end of the measure where it first occurs. It is highly recommended to specify the function of the metaMark using its function attribute, which may take the following values: confirmation : confirmation of a previous textual decision; i.e. , cancellation of a deleted passage in a different writing medium. addition : denoted material is to be inserted in the musical text. deletion : denoted material is no longer part of the musical text. substitution : denoted material is replaced, either by the musical text pointed at with the target attribute or the musical content of the metaMark element itself. clarification : attempt to clarify a potentially illegible or otherwise unclear part of the musical text. question : marks a section of the musical text which is to be considered further. investigation : marks a section of the musical text as an investigation of the consequences of certain compositional decisions or potential alternatives. restoration : declares a formerly cancelled part of the musical text as valid again. navigation : clarification of the reading order of the musical text. Some metaMarks may have actual content, like marginal notes. This content may be transcribed inside the metaMark element. It also has a facs attribute to refer back to the corresponding sections of a facsimile. It is important to keep in mind that metaMark elements do not encode the textual consequences they transport – this is an encoding of the sign, not of its meaning, which can be encoded in other elements like restore . metaMarks in Beethoven’s op.59.3, p.18 The above excerpt from a Beethoven manuscript holds a number of different metaMarks, some of which are encoded in the following examples: <metaMark staff=\"1\" place=\"below\" function=\"restoration\">gut<\/metaMark> The metaMark above captures the word ‘gut’ (good) Beethoven wrote below the red pencil, which indicates that the formerly deleted text of the two measures shown shall be kept. <metaMark function=\"clarification\"> Nb: diese<lb\/>Zwei Täkte<lb\/>sind gut, und<lb\/>bleiben <\/metaMark> This metaMark transcribes Beethoven’s marginal note explaining the same situation as above. <metaMark staff=\"3\" place=\"above\" tstamp=\"4\" function=\"clarification\">g<\/metaMark> This third metaMark covers one of the letters Beethoven inserted to clarify the pitch of that given note.","url":"content\/scholarlyediting.html#metatexts","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"11.1.1 Genetic Changes at the Page Level","desc":" foliaDesc patch cutout add del genState","remarks":"In genetic editions, it may also be of interest to trace when pages are added and \/ or removed from manuscripts.

Both approaches may be combined, so that the encoding of the musical content and digital facsimiles may add different facets to the same MEI document.","url":"content\/facsimilesperformances.html#facsimiles","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"12.1.1 Elements of the Facsimile Module","desc":" facsimile music manifestation source surface figDesc graphic zone note measure pb foliaDesc","remarks":"This module makes available the following elements for encoding facsimiles: These element are used to add a separate subtree to MEI, starting with the facsimile element inside music , as seen in the following example: <mei> <meiHead> <!-- metadata header --> <\/meiHead> <music> <facsimile> <!-- The facsimile subtree starts here. --> <\/facsimile> <body> <!-- The encoding of the musical content goes here. --> <\/body> <\/music> <\/mei> It is possible to have more than one facsimile element in this location. This is especially useful when multiple sources are encoded in the same file using the mechanisms described in chapter of these Guidelines. In this case, the decls (declarations) attribute of facsimile may be used to refer to a source defined in the document’s header, as seen in the following example: <mei> <meiHead> <fileDesc> <sourceDesc> <source xml:id=\"facsimile.source1\"> <!-- description of source --> <\/source> <\/sourceDesc> <\/fileDesc> <\/meiHead> <music> <facsimile decls=\"#facsimile.source1\"> <!-- facsimile content --> <\/facsimile> <\/music> <\/mei> When using the FRBR model (see ), it is equally possible to reference a manifestation element instead of source . Within a facsimile element, each page of the source is represented by a surface element. Each surface may be assigned an identifying string utilizing the label attribute. In addition, it may encapsulate more detailed metadata about itself in a figDesc element. The coordinate space of the surface may be recorded in abstract terms in the ulx , uly , lrx , and lry attributes. For navigation purposes, surface has a startid attribute that accommodates pointing to the first object appearing on this particular writing surface. <facsimile> <surface label=\"page 1\" lrx=\"2000\" lry=\"3000\" startid=\"#measure1\" ulx=\"0\" uly=\"0\"\/> <\/facsimile> Within surface elements, one may nest one or more graphic elements, each providing a reference to an image file that represents the writing surface. Multiple graphic elements are permitted in order to accommodate alternative versions (different resolutions or formats, for instance) of the surface image. In spite of changes in resolution or format, all images must contain the same content, i.e. , the entire writing surface. A graphic may refer to a single page within a multi-page document, which is – at least for Adobe PDF documents – available through a #page=X suffix to the target attribute. <facsimile> <surface> <graphic height=\"2000px\" target=\"image1.jpg\" width=\"3000px\"\/> <graphic height=\"1000px\" target=\"image1smaller.jpg\" width=\"1500px\"\/> <graphic height=\"200px\" target=\"image1smallest.png\" width=\"300px\"\/> <\/surface> <\/facsimile> <facsimile> <surface> <graphic height=\"297mm\" target=\"source1.pdf#page=1\" width=\"210mm\"\/> <\/surface> <surface> <graphic height=\"297mm\" target=\"source1.pdf#page=2\" width=\"210mm\"\/> <\/surface> <\/facsimile> The preceding markup will provide the basis for most page-turning applications. Often, however, it is desirable to focus attention on particular areas of the graphical representation of the surface. The zone element fulfills this purpose: <surface lrx=\"3000\" lry=\"2000\" ulx=\"0\" uly=\"0\"> <graphic height=\"2000px\" target=\"image1.jpg\" width=\"3000px\"\/> <zone lrx=\"370\" lry=\"410\" ulx=\"300\" uly=\"200\"\/> <zone lrx=\"439\" lry=\"410\" ulx=\"367\" uly=\"200\"\/> <zone lrx=\"512\" lry=\"410\" ulx=\"436\" uly=\"200\"\/> <\/surface> The coordinates of each zone define a space relative to the coordinate space of its parent surface . Note that this is not necessarily the same coordinate space defined by the width and height attributes of the graphic that represents the surface. The zone coordinates in the preceding example do not represent regions within the graphic, but rather regions of the writing surface . Because the coordinate space of a zone is defined relative to that of a surface, it is possible to provide multiple graphic elements and multiple zone elements within a single surface. In the following example, two different images representing the entire surface are provided alongside specification of two zones of interest within the surface: <surface lrx=\"3000\" lry=\"2000\" ulx=\"0\" uly=\"0\"> <graphic height=\"2000px\" target=\"image1.jpg\" width=\"3000px\"\/> <graphic height=\"1995px\" target=\"image1cropped.jpg\" width=\"2995px\"\/> <zone lrx=\"370\" lry=\"410\" ulx=\"300\" uly=\"200\"\/> <zone lrx=\"30\" lry=\"30\" ulx=\"0\" uly=\"0\"\/> <\/surface> A zone element may contain figDesc or graphic elements that provide detailed descriptive information about the zone and additional images, e.g., at a different\/higher resolution, of the rectangle defined by the zone. The data objects contained within the zone may also be specified through the use of the data attribute, which contains ID references to one more elements in the content tree of the MEI file, such as a note , measure , etc. <!-- In the facsimile subtree: --> <zone data=\"#facsimile.measure1\" xml:id=\"facsimile.zone1\"\/> <!-- somewhere in the content: --> <measure xml:id=\"facsimile.measure1\"> <!-- measure content --> <\/measure> Conversely, an element in the content may refer to the facsimile subtree using its facs attribute, which is made available by the att.facsimile attribute class. The last example could therefore be encoded with pointers in the other direction: <!-- In the facsimile subtree: --> <zone xml:id=\"facsimile.zone2\"\/> <!-- somewhere in the content: --> <measure facs=\"#facsimile.zone2\" xml:id=\"facsimile.measure2\"> <!-- measure content --> <\/measure> The pb element defined in the makes special use of the facs attribute, in that it does not point to a zone , but a surface element instead. A pb marks the beginning of a page, so it can be concluded that all elements in the content tree which are encoded between any two pb elements encode musical symbols written on the page ( surface ) referenced by the first of these two pb element’s facs attribute. The encoding of facsimile elements is intended to support sequential display of page images. If an encoder wants to describe the physical setup of a source document, the foliaDesc element is more appropriate. The difference of both approaches, and how to combine them, is described in chapter .","url":"content\/facsimilesperformances.html#facsimileElements","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"12.1 Performances","desc":"","remarks":"This chapter describes the ‘performance’ module, which can be used for organizing audio and video files of performances of a musical work. The elements provided allow the encoder to group different recordings of the same performance, identify temporal segments within the recordings, and encode simple alignments with a music text.","url":"content\/facsimilesperformances.html#performances","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"12.1.1 Overview","desc":" performance music body facsimile recording avFile clip when extData extMeta meiHead att.mediaBounds","remarks":"The following elements are available to encode information about a recorded performance: The performance element begins a subtree of the music element and appears alongside with, or instead of, body (described in ) and facsimile (described in ). A performance element represents one recorded performance event. As a performance may be recorded in multiple formats or by different personnel or using different equipment, the performance element may group one or more recordings of the event. The decls attribute can be used to point to performance medium metadata for the performed work. See and for more details. The recording element identifies a single recording event taking place within an absolute temporal space. The class att.mediaBounds contains attributes that can be used to define this space: The avFile element identifies an external file associated with a recording act. In the simplest case, the recording element will contain one avFile element identifying a file that represents it. The target attribute contains the URI of the digital media file. Use of the mimetype attribute is recommended for the avFile element. Its value should be a valid MIME media type defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force in RFC 2046. It is also recommended that all avFile elements have a recording or clip parent which bears the begin , end , and betype attributes. <performance> <recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:10.00\"> <avFile mimetype=\"audio\/wav\" target=\"http:\/\/example.com\/path\/to\/audio\/recording\"\/> <\/recording> <\/performance> Sometimes, multiple digital files are created in order to provide greater flexibility in redistribution and playback capabilities. In this case, multiple avFile elements may occur, each with a different mimetype. Keep in mind, however, that each file still represents the complete temporal extent of the recording act in spite of the change of file format: <performance> <recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:10.00\"> <avFile mimetype=\"audio\/wav\" target=\"http:\/\/example.com\/path\/to\/audio\/recording\/wav\"\/> <avFile mimetype=\"audio\/mpeg\" target=\"http:\/\/example.com\/path\/to\/audio\/recording\/mpeg\"\/> <\/recording> <\/performance> The clip element identifies a temporal segment of a recording act. In the following example, the clip begins two minutes into the timeframe of the recording and ends 20 seconds later: <recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:10.00\"> <clip begin=\"00:02:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:20:20.00\"\/> <\/recording> Beyond these relatively simple uses, complex situations may occur that require equally complex markup. For example, a single performance may be represented by multiple digital media files. Because they have differing durations, the media files must be the result of separate recording acts, even if these recording acts took place at the same time: <performance> <recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:10.00\"> <avFile mimetype=\"audio\/wav\" target=\"http:\/\/example.com\/path\/to\/audio\/recording\/wav\"\/> <\/recording> <recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:15.00\"> <avFile mimetype=\"audio\/mpeg\" target=\"http:\/\/example.com\/path\/to\/audio\/recording\/mpg\"\/> <\/recording> <\/performance> A single performance may also be represented by multiple, sequential digital files, as when a complete work is recorded in several so-called ‘takes’. In this case, the files may be considered to be parts of a single recording act, the extent of which is the combined extent of the individual clips. For example, a series of clip elements may be used to identify each movement of a piece and give start and end times for the movements in relation to the overall temporal space of the complete work: <performance> <recording> <clip begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:07:00.00\" n=\"mov1\"> <avFile mimetype=\"audio\/aiff\" target=\"movement01.aiff\"\/> <\/clip> <clip begin=\"00:07:01.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:12:03.00\" n=\"mov2\"> <avFile mimetype=\"audio\/aiff\" target=\"movement02.aiff\"\/> <\/clip> <\/recording> <\/performance> Similar markup is also applicable when a single file representing the entirety of a recording act is broken into segments later, as is often done for practical storage and distribution reasons. The file from which the clips are derived is indicated using an avFile element: <performance> <recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:12:03.00\" n=\"completeWork\"> <avFile mimetype=\"audio\/aiff\" target=\"completeWork.aiff\"\/> <clip begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:07:00.00\" n=\"mov1\"> <avFile mimetype=\"audio\/aiff\" target=\"movement01.aiff\"\/> <\/clip> <clip begin=\"00:07:02.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:12:03.00\" n=\"mov2\"> <avFile mimetype=\"audio\/aiff\" target=\"movement02.aiff\"\/> <\/clip> <\/recording> <\/performance> A clip may be used to define any region of interest, such as a cadenza or a modulation, a song verse, etc. The following example shows the use of clip and its attributes to identify significant sections of a recording: <performance> <recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:05:21.00\"> <!-- Exposition --> <clip begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:01:41.00\"\/> <!-- Development --> <clip begin=\"00:01:41.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:14.00\"\/> <!-- Recapitulation --> <clip begin=\"00:03:14.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:04:28.00\"\/> <!-- Coda --> <clip begin=\"00:04:28.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:05:21.00\"\/> <\/recording> <\/performance> The preceding example also demonstrates that media files are not required in order to define the temporal space of a recording act or clip. This makes it possible to set the boundaries of these features, then use the content of the performance element as a rudimentary \"edit decision list\" to create the matching digital files. If an encoding of the notated text with which the media files are associated is included in the MEI file, the startid attribute can be used to indicate the first element in the sequence of events to which the recording corresponds: <performance> <recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:07:00.00\" n=\"mov1\" startid=\"#performance.m1_1\"> <avFile mimetype=\"audio\/aiff\" target=\"fullpiece.aiff\"\/> <\/recording> <\/performance> <!-- ... --> <body> <mdiv> <score> <section> <measure n=\"1\" xml:id=\"performance.m1_1\"> <!-- ... --> <\/measure> <\/section> <\/score> <\/mdiv> <\/body> Clips can also be aligned with components of the musical text encoded in the body . The startid attribute can be used to specify the starting element in the sequence of events to which the clip corresponds. The following example shows the use of clip elements to identify the exposition of the first movement from Beethoven’s piano sonata Op. 14, no. 2 and its concluding ‘codetta’. <performance> <recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:05:21.00\"> <avFile mimetype=\"audio\/aiff\" target=\"BeethovenOp14N2-Mov1.aiff\"\/> <!-- Exposition --> <clip begin=\"00:00:0.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:01:41.00\" startid=\"#performance.m1\"\/> <!-- Exposition's \"codetta\" --> <clip begin=\"00:01:31.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:01:41.00\" startid=\"#performance.m48\"\/> <\/recording> <\/performance> <!-- ... --> <body> <mdiv> <score> <section> <measure n=\"1\" xml:id=\"performance.m1\"> <!-- ... --> <\/measure> <!-- ... --> <measure n=\"48\" xml:id=\"performance.m48\"> <!-- ... --> <\/measure> <\/section> <\/score> <\/mdiv> <\/body> Please note that the begin and end times of clips may overlap. In the preceding example, the extent of the codetta is contained within that of the exposition. Overlapping beginning and ending points may also be used to provide additional performance context for a segment or because there is uncertainty with regard to precise values for these points. <performance> <recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:03:06.54\"> <!-- a section of interest --> <clip begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:00:41.00\"\/> <!-- the following section starts a little before the end of the previous one to give some \"adjustment\" time --> <clip begin=\"00:00:31.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:01:07.00\"\/> <!-- the boundaries of the following section are \"fuzzy\" --> <clip begin=\"00:02:18.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:02:49.85\"\/> <\/recording> <\/performance> A bibliographic description of a recording or metadata explaining how clip boundaries were determined may be associated with the recording and clip elements via the decls attribute: <performance> <recording begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" decls=\"#performance.recBibDesc\" end=\"00:03:06.54\"> <!-- a section of interest --> <clip begin=\"00:00:00.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:00:41.00\"\/> <!-- the following section starts a little before the end of the previous one to give some \"adjustment\" time --> <clip begin=\"00:00:31.00\" betype=\"time\" decls=\"#performance.clipDesc\" end=\"00:01:07.00\"\/> <!-- the boundaries of the following section are \"fuzzy\" --> <clip begin=\"00:02:18.00\" betype=\"time\" end=\"00:02:49.85\"\/> <\/recording> <\/performance> Associations between a feature of the encoding, such as a note, dynamic mark, or annotation, and a time point, may be created using when elements and when attributes. The when element identifies a particular point in time during the playback of a media file, such as an audio recording. <when absolute=\"00:00:01.915291666\" abstype=\"time\" xml:id=\"t1\"\/> Time points may be identified in absolute terms as above; that is, in hours, minutes, and seconds since the beginning of the recording, or in relative terms using the interval , inttype , and since attributes. In the following example, the time point of interest happens 48 frames after the occurrence of the point labelled as \"t1\". <when interval=\"48\" inttype=\"smpte-ndf29.97\" since=\"#t1\" xml:id=\"t1.1\"\/> Having identified a point of interest, another feature of the encoding may be associated with this point using its when attribute: <annot resp=\"#LvB\" when=\"#t1\"> <p>I like this part!<\/p> <\/annot> One use of the association created between the annotation and the time point is to display the text of the annotation as the recording or clip is played. The when attributes allows only a single value, so only one-to-one relationships can be created using this mechanism. However, one-to-many relationships are accommodated in the opposite direction; that is, from a time point to other features of the markup. For example, <when xml:id=\"t1.2\" absolute=\"00:00:01.915291666\" abstype=\"time\" data=\"#feature1 #feature2 #feature3\"\/> indicates that the entities identified in data all occur at the same instant. extData is a container for holding non-MEI data formats, similar to extMeta but available in when rather than in meiHead . extData allows for data from audio or other sources to be linked to notes or other score events. Data should be enclosed in a CDATA tag. The following example shows JSON formatted performance data encoded with extMeta for a single note (presumed to be defined elsewhere in the document as with the ID \"note_1\"). Both single-value summaries ( e.g. , pitch) and time series values ( e.g. , contF0) are encoded. <when absolute=\"00:00:00.00\" xml:id=\"when_1\" data=\"#note_1\"> <extData> &lt;![CDATA[ {\"offset\": \"00:00:02.9005\", \"pitch\": \"455.98\", \"contF0\": [454.3737606, 454.7165531, 455.2337513, 455.4622624, 456.0605954]} ]]&gt; <\/extData> <\/when>","url":"content\/facsimilesperformances.html#perfElements","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"B13 Linking Data","desc":"","remarks":"This chapter describes the use of elements in MEI for linking and referencing.

These link elements indicate an association between themselves (or one of their ancestors) and one or more other entities, either inside the same document or elsewhere. An association between two elements in the same document is said to be an ‘internal’ link, while an association that involves an entity outside the current document is called an ‘external’ link. However, either of the elements discussed in the following section can be used for either purpose.","url":"content\/linkingdata.html#links","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"13.1.1 General Relationships Between Elements","desc":" surface zone note measure staff annot when att.linking att.alignment att.dataPointing att.facsimile","remarks":"MEI offers several attributes in the att.linking class for the description of basic relationships: The att.alignment class contains an attribute for describing temporal relationships: The att.dataPointing class provides an attribute for pointing from the header into the music content: To reference images, the att.facsimile class provides an attribute for pointing to surface and zone elements: These attributes accommodate the encoding of linkages between the element carrying the attribute and one or more other elements. All of them use URIs to establish the connection. While the examples below illustrate relationships between musical events, the use of the aforementioned attributes is not restricted to musical events. On the contrary, these attributes can be used to capture information about relations between any elements. Using the attributes above makes it possible to create relationships between events, which are often widely-spaced in both encoded order and time. The attributes allow a large number of connections, enhancing the informational content, and therefore the potential usefulness, of the encoding. The copyof attribute points to an element of which the current element is a copy. It can be used to repeat a note, for example, without encoding the whole note element again. The copy is a ‘deep’ one; that is, the copyof attribute copies all attributes and child elements which belong to the copied element, such as the dur and oct attributes of a copied note . The value of the copyof attribute must be a URI, which usually refers to an element in the current document. The following example demonstrates use of the copyof attribute: <section> <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <note xml:id=\"analysis.note1_1\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <measure n=\"2\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <note copyof=\"#analysis.note1_1\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <\/section> In this example, the note in the second measure has exactly the same characteristics as the note in the first measure . Using copyof is not limited to copying events. The copyof attribute can also be used to copy an entire measure or staff . When there are many repeated features, the use of the copyof greatly reduces encoding effort. The image and the following encoding of the beginning of Schubert’s Erlkönig illustrates the benefit of using the copyof attribute. First measure of Schubert’s Erlkönig <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <tuplet num=\"3\" num.visible=\"true\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup1\"> <chord dur=\"8\"> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <\/chord> <chord dur=\"8\"> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <\/chord> <chord dur=\"8\"> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <\/chord> <\/tuplet> <tuplet copyof=\"#analysis.tup1\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup2\"\/> <tuplet copyof=\"#analysis.tup1\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup3\"\/> <tuplet copyof=\"#analysis.tup1\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup4\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> This example can be reduced further by using copyof inside the initial tuplet to represent the repeated chords: <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <mRest\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer> <tuplet num=\"3\" num.visible=\"true\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup5\"> <chord dur=\"8\" xml:id=\"analysis.t1c1\"> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <\/chord> <chord copyof=\"#analysis.t1c1\"\/> <chord copyof=\"#analysis.t1c1\"\/> <\/tuplet> <tuplet copyof=\"#analysis.tup5\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup6\"\/> <tuplet copyof=\"#analysis.tup5\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup7\"\/> <tuplet copyof=\"#analysis.tup5\" xml:id=\"analysis.tup8\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"3\"> <layer> <mRest\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> While copyof signifies a duplicate copy of an element, the sameas indicates that the current element represents exactly the same entity as the one referenced in sameas . Use of sameas is used for describing the same entity from multiple perspectives, e.g. , the same event in two layers. While copyof and sameas have defined semantics, the corresp may be used to create user-defined relationships between elements. The example below demonstrates the encoding of a relationship between the third note and the fermata, even though the fermata is not placed directly above the note. <measure n=\"1\" right=\"end\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"analysis.note1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" xml:id=\"analysis.note2\"\/> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"analysis.note3\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <fermata corresp=\"#analysis.note3\" place=\"above\" tstamp=\"4.75\"\/> <\/measure> The corresp attribute only marks the correspondence between the current element and one or more other entities. To describe the nature of the correspondence, one must use annot . One possible usage of corresp is to link related editorial markup. Because of the hierarchical nature of XML it may be necessary to split related editorial markup into multiple elements. In the following example, corresp is used to encode the relationship between those elements. A one-to-many relationship between the current element and the entities being referred to can be expressed by using a list of space-separated URIs in corresp . The next and prev attributes point to elements which follow or precede the current element in some fashion other than that indicated by encoding order. The use of these attributes helps to avoid confusion in the sequence of events, for example, in voice leading across layers or staves, when the encoding reflects the physical arrangement of voices. In the second measure of the following example, the target of the next attribute occurs after the pointing element in time, but before it in encoding order: Bach Chorale, Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh' darein, m. 6-7 <measure n=\"6\" xml:id=\"analysis.m_sc_62\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_63_3\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_65_3\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" fermata=\"above\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_67_3\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_68_3\"\/> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\"> <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_63_2\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_64_2\"\/> <\/beam> <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_65_2\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_66_2\"\/> <\/beam> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" next=\"#analysis.n_sc_68_2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_67_2\"\/> <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_68_1\"\/> <note accid=\"n\" dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_69_1\"\/> <\/beam> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_63_1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_65_1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_67_1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_68_2\"\/> <\/layer> <layer n=\"1\"> <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"n_sc_63_0\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"d\" xml:id=\"n_sc_64_0\"\/> <\/beam> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"n_sc_65_0\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" fermata=\"below\" oct=\"2\" pname=\"b\" xml:id=\"n_sc_67_0\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"n_sc_68_0\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <measure n=\"7\" xml:id=\"m_sc_70\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_71_3\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_72_3\"\/> <\/beam> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_73_3\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_75_3\"\/> <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_76_3\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_77_3\"\/> <\/beam> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\"> <space dur=\"4\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_73_2\"\/> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_75_2\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_76_2\"\/> <\/layer> <layer n=\"3\"> <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_71_1\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_72_1\"\/> <\/beam> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_73_1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_75_1\"\/> <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_76_1\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_77_1\"\/> <\/beam> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" next=\"#analysis.n_sc_73_2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"a\" xml:id=\"analysis.n_sc_71_2\"\/> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\"> <note accid=\"n\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" xml:id=\"n_sc_71_0\"\/> <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"n_sc_73_0\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"d\" xml:id=\"n_sc_74_0\"\/> <\/beam> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\" xml:id=\"n_sc_75_0\"\/> <beam> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"2\" pname=\"a\" xml:id=\"n_sc_76_0\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"2\" pname=\"b\" xml:id=\"n_sc_77_0\"\/> <\/beam> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> The next and prev attributes may also be useful to clarify a sequence of entities which occurs across some form of interruption, in this case, notes before and after a new system or page beginning where there is no custos or direct in the source: <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <note dur=\"4\" next=\"#analysis.m1s1e2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"up\" xml:id=\"analysis.m1s1e1\"\/> <pb\/> <note dur=\"8\" next=\"#analysis.m1s1e3\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" prev=\"#analysis.m1s1e1\" stem.dir=\"up\" xml:id=\"analysis.m1s1e2\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" prev=\"#analysis.m1s1e2\" stem.dir=\"up\" xml:id=\"analysis.m1s1e3\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> The synch attribute points to an element that is synchronous with; that is, begins at the same moment in time, as the current element.

In the following example, an <svg:path> element is inserted into a surface . It would now be possible for measures or other music features to point to the rectangular zone in MEI namespace, or the fancy shaped <svg:path> using their facs attribute (see for that mechanism). It’s equally possible to use SVG content inside figures on title pages or anywhere else.

The purpose of this module is to allow for integrating MIDI data into MEI-encoded notation, to both aid software in translating MEI to MIDI, and to permit the capture of information in files that have been translated from MIDI to MEI. The MIDI model in MEI is similar to that of Mup, and the user is directed to the Mup User Guide for further reading. The MIDI module defines certain generally-accepted MIDI units that may be used outside of a MIDI context. For example, the dur.ppq attribute accepts MIDI ppq (Pulses Per Quarter) as a valid measurement of duration. Similarly, the pnum attribute allows MIDI note numbers for specifying a pitch value.","url":"content\/integration.html#midiGuidelines","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"14.1.1 PPQ in scoreDef and staffDef","desc":" scoreDef staffDef","remarks":"To define the MIDI resolution of a score, the ppq attribute may be used on the scoreDef element.

However, these independent values for ppq are only interpretable in terms of a common time base. Therefore, the ppq attribute is required on scoreDef when the values of ppq on the staff definitions differ.

In earlier versions of MEI, the noteOn and noteOff elements were used to record MIDI note on\/off events. The use of these elements is now discouraged in favor of using the note element directly. MIDI duration should be recorded using the dur.ges attribute, and MIDI pitch information should be recorded using the pnum attribute. MIDI control changes ( cc ) are encoded using the num and val attributes. Control change numbers are specified in the General MIDI documentation. In the example below, the cc elements encode increasing controller event 7 (volume) values, or in musical terms, a crescendo. Other MIDI event messages follow this same pattern, using the num and val attributes to record the raw MIDI data. <measure> <staff> <layer> <note dur.ges=\"8\" pnum=\"45\"\/> <note dur.ges=\"8\" pnum=\"42\"\/> <note dur.ges=\"8\" pnum=\"43\"\/> <note dur.ges=\"8\" pnum=\"44\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <midi layer=\"1\" staff=\"1\"> <cc num=\"7\" tstamp=\".5\" val=\"50\"\/> <cc num=\"7\" tstamp=\"1.5\" val=\"55\"\/> <cc num=\"7\" tstamp=\"2\" val=\"60\"\/> <cc num=\"7\" tstamp=\"2.5\" val=\"65\"\/> <\/midi> <\/measure> In the preceding example, each control change is associated with a time stamp. The tstamp attribute is required in order to indicate when the MIDI event should take place. It is often necessary to indicate a time stamp slightly earlier than the affected notes to compensate for MIDI delay. For better legibility and error checking, the midi element may be used, as in the following example, to group MIDI parameter changes. Even so, the tstamp attribute is required on all parameters in order to associate them with their point of actuation: <midi layer=\"1\" staff=\"1\"> <cc num=\"7\" tstamp=\".5\" val=\"50\"\/> <cc num=\"64\" tstamp=\".5\" val=\"64\"\/> <\/midi>","url":"content\/integration.html#midiData","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"14.1.1 MIDI in Mensural and Neume Notation","desc":"","remarks":"In mensural, neume, and other historical or non-Western repertoires, there is often no measure-based time stamp with which to associate MIDI controller data.
