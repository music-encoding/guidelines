Through the use of natural-language definitions and examples, this documentation assists users of MEI in achieving effective and consistent markup. Despite translating XML and RNG terminology and concepts into more accessible language, it is still a technical one that presupposes a minimal understanding of XML and music notation. Novice encoders may want to start their MEI experience by doing an introductory tutorial first. These Guidelines will provide recommendations and arguments for encoding different types of music notation for a variety of purposes. While the specification of the framework is complete, the description is not necessarily complete. MEI is used in various contexts, and not every use-case may be fully reflected in these Guidelines. However, MEI is a community effort, so feedback and suggestions for improvement are highly welcome. Several starting points to get in touch with the MEI community can be found on the MEI website . These Guidelines make use of real-world examples to illustrate appropriate encoding concepts. We consider the use of such images as fair use. Contributors to these Guidelines are requested to given proper reference to the libraries holding the material used here.

Grateful acknowledgment is given to the following institutions for their generous contributions: the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur (AdW) in Mainz for serving as hosting institution for the MEI Community, and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for their joint financial support of the MEI project in its early stages. We thank several institutions that hosted Music Encoding Conferences or other MEI-related meetings in the past: The AdW Mainz, the University of Virginia Library, the Biblioteca Umanistica of the Università degli Studi Firenze, McGill University Montréal, the Centre d’études supérieures de la Renaissance Tours, the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) in College Park, the Oxford e-Research Centre, the Universität Paderborn and the Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften Wien in conjunction with the Universität Wien and the Mozarteum Salzburg. We also thank all other institutions that allow their researchers to invest time into both the community and the encoding framework. It is their interest that makes MEI an incredible platform for interchange and scholarly progress. The Text Encoding Initiative is also owed a special debt of gratitude. In addition to providing much of the inspiration for MEI, the TEI organization supplied funding for the MEI Technical Group in its efforts to adopt ODD. The editors of these Guidelines are grateful for those of the TEI, which provided a stellar exemplar and from which we have borrowed shamelessly.

Perhaps the most important additions are the enhancements for the MEI tablature module, particularly the support for German Lute Tablature (GLT). Notable fixes to the guidelines include correcting the description of the optimize attribute on scoreDef to clarify that empty staves are not displayed when its value is set to 'true'. The Release Managers for MEI 5.1 were the Technical Co-Chairs, Benjamin W. Bohl and Stefan Münnich. With MEI 5.1, five additional elements have been added to the schema: tuning , course , string , tabDurSym , and tabGrp . All of these elements are used to encode tablature notation. The use of these elements, including relevant attributes, is documented in the largely rewritten chapter of these Guidelines. The existing att.stringtab.tuning attribute class has been deprecated in favor of these additions and will be removed in a future version of MEI. The new att.dataSelecting class (currently available only on symbolDef ) introduces an XPath-based selection mechanism to identify elements to which certain features apply. All controlevents (see , technically implemented through membership in the att.controlEvent class) are now member of att.color , enabling color customization through the color attribute. Similarly, directive-like elements ( bend , breath , caesura , cpMark , fermata , fing , fingGrp , harm , harpPedal , metaMark , mordent , octave , ornam , trill , and turn ) are now member of the att.verticalGroup class, which gives them access to the vgrp attribute, facilitating vertical alignment.

For scholarly research, this flexibility is necessary and is one of the greatest strengths of MEI. At the same time, we recognize that this flexibility presents challenges for broad adoption of MEI as a notation interchange format. For developers, providing \"full\" MEI support is a difficult and time-consuming chore, writing and supporting code for features which most of their users will not use. Accordingly, MEI has not seen a great deal of adoption by current score-writing applications. This is addressed this with the release of MEI 5. We are now offering a new customization of MEI, MEI Basic , that provides a simplified subset of the MEI framework that reflects the capabilities of most popular \"Common Western Music Notation\" score-writing applications currently in use. In the full MEI schema there are often multiple ways to encode something. MEI Basic simplifies this by providing only one approach for each music feature, making it significantly easier to provide full feature support in software. As noted, MEI Basic only supports Common Western Music Notation. Many of the more complex encoding mechanisms for editorial and analytical workflows are also removed in MEI Basic. MEI Basic has a relatively small footprint of supported features, which may be expanded over time as more software applications adopt MEI and more use cases are identified. All MEI Basic files are valid MEI \"full\" files, meaning MEI Basic files may be expanded and upgraded to MEI \"full\", adding more complex features and encoding mechanisms as required. We hope that this customization facilitates more application adoption, data sharing between MEI projects, and conversion between MEI and other data formats.","url":"content\/introduction.html#meiBasic","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1.1 Guidelines","desc":"","remarks":"With MEI 5, we re-introduce a PDF version of the MEI Guidelines. With a total of more than 5,700 pages, this PDF clearly is not intended to be printed, but may serve as a single-file reference to the current release of MEI. The PDF is interactive, so may be offline with working links between sections. While the largest part of the PDF is taken up by the formal specification of the format, there are also more than 370 pages of prose documentation and examples of how to use the MEI framework for various purposes. The PDF therefore gives a good impression of the huge effort that went into the development of MEI. The Guidelines have also had several notable contributions, led in large part by our Interest Groups. These contributions have sought to make some chapters more clear and consistent, to help newcomers to MEI understand how MEI encoding may be applied. In total, we have over 40 contributors actively involved in the preparation of this release of MEI. Many of them are early-career researchers, investing significant time and effort into the MEI Framework. Due to the open nature of this community work, happening alongside conferences, workshops, and other meetings, others may not be listed properly because of rather informal, but no less important, contributions. Without the joint effort of all those involved, an undertaking like MEI would not be possible.","url":"content\/introduction.html#pdfGuidelines","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1.1 Model changes in MEI","desc":" plica stem divLine repeatMark extData pgHead pgFoot rest mRest mSpace multiRest arpeg scoreDef staffDef","remarks":"MEI 5.0 introduces five new elements: plica and stem , for the encoding of documents written in Mensural notation, and divLine for Neumes documents. The new CMN element repeatMark can be used to express repetition marks as a combination of text and symbols, and the added shared element extData provides a container for non-MEI data formats. The release technically removes the <fingerprint> element, which has been deprecated for ten years. It also removes the elements <pgHead2> and <pgFoot2>, which are now superseded by the func attribute on pgHead and pgFoot respectively. Most other changes affect more specific aspects in the model of MEI, usually expressed in attributes. These include the refinement of the encoding of key signatures, with key.sig moved to keysig , keysig.show moved to keysig.visible , and keysig.showchange and sig.showchange moved to keysig.cancelaccid and cancelaccid respectively. The instr attribute is removed from quiet events like rest , mRest , mSpace and multiRest , and the visible attribute is also removed from mRest . Moreover, attributes line.form and line.width on the arpeg element are aligned with other line-like elements as lform and lwidth . text.dist on scoreDef and staffDef is removed in favor of the newly added attributes dir.dist , reh.dist or tempo.dist . meter.form =\"invis\" is updated to meter.visible =\"false\", and the same change applies to form =\"invis\" on meterSig, now replaced with visible =\"false\". The text-rendition values of letter-spacing and line-height on rend are moved to separate attributes, that is, rend =\"letter-spacing(0.25) line-height(120%)\" will be now letterspacing =\"0.25\" lineheight =\"120%\". Additionally, corrections are applied to specific attribute values, such as changing Bagpipe on midi.instrname to Bag_pipe and replacing dblwhole on head.mod with fences . All changes can be traced in the detailed Release Notes auto-generated from the Pull Requests on GitHub. A larger group of changes affects the internal class structure of MEI only, where significant effort went into improved consistency in naming things. While this set of changes does not affect end users of MEI during validation of files, they may have consequences for local customizations which reference classes not available anymore. If you have advanced local customizations based on MEI v4 or older releases, please check that the rules provided still work as expected under v5.

These changes are designed to help improve the development workflow of MEI, improving consistency and oversight of changes as they are contributed to MEI. Our new setup is explained in great detail in the project README file . We have also expanded our Contribution Guidelines and other documentation files in the music-encoding GitHub repository . The MEI documentation and guidelines are now expressed in TEI ODD again, moving away from the MarkDown-based approach used in the preparation of MEI v4 documentation. This re-introduces greater compatibility with the TEI toolset. The source code for both the Guidelines and the Specification is now jointly contained in the music-encoding GitHub repository , which simplifies validation across both parts of MEI. All assets – web documentation, PDF Guidelines, and schemata – are automatically generated from there. A multi-platform Docker image for running these processes locally is also provided to help new developers with getting started in contributing to MEI. Setting up these technical workflows has taken considerable effort, but should now simplify future development and releases considerably. In addition to the main Music Encoding schema and Guidelines, we have also updated our Sample Encodings and Encoding Tools repositories. Sample Encodings have been updated to MEI 5.0, and several problems with encodings from older releases have been fixed. In the Encoding Tools, several bugs were fixed with older upgrade XSLT scripts, and a new XSLT for upgrading MEI 4 to MEI 5 was added.

Bent, et al. \"Notation.\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 25 May 2010. http:\/\/www.oxfordmusiconline.com\/subscriber\/article\/grove\/music\/20114 .) However, MEI’s understanding is more inclusive than this restrictive definition, i.e. , Braille certainly qualifies as music notation documents. The encoding scheme permits both the creation of new music notation documents and the conversion of existing ones from print and other electronic formats. However, conversion of existing documents may require revisions in content or rearrangement of information.","url":"content\/introduction.html#definitionsAndParameters","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 General Principles","desc":"","remarks":"MEI may be used to encode both primary sources of music notation, such as an autograph or published score, and secondary sources, such as a scholarly edition based on one or more primary sources. The format encompasses both use cases, and the encoder must choose the elements and attributes most appropriate in each case. These Guidelines aim to provide guidance on that task. As an encoded representation of one or more music notation documents, an MEI file may be employed as a surrogate for the original materials. Although the encoding scheme does not define or prescribe intellectual content for music notation documents, it does define content designation and is intended to be used with available data content standards. MEI identifies the essential data elements within music notation documents and establishes codes and conventions necessary for capturing and distinguishing information within those elements for future action or manipulation. While there are a few elements that ought to appear in any MEI document, various intellectual, technical, and economic factors influence the level of detail of analysis and encoding actually undertaken. Taking this into consideration, the encoding scheme is designed with a minimum of required elements and allows for progressively more detailed levels of description as desired. The encoding scheme preserves and enhances the current functionality of existing music notation documents. It permits identification of document structures and content that support description, navigation, analysis, and online and print presentation. The encoding scheme is intended to facilitate interchange between notational tools. It aims to assist in the creation of more effective and consistent encoding, encourage the creation of cooperatively-created and widely available databases of music notation documents, and permit the reuse of encoded data for multiple output purposes. It will also ensure that machine-readable music notation documents will outlive changing hardware and software environments because they are based on a platform-independent standard.","url":"content\/introduction.html#generalPrinciples","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 Structural Features","desc":"","remarks":"The encoding scheme is based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML), a text-based format for representing structured information. It is expressed as a One Document Does-it-all (ODD) document. For more information on ODD, please refer to . Related or complementary standards, such as the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange , the Encoded Archival Description (EAD) , MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data , existing notation encoding schemes, etc. have been consulted and employed as appropriate. For example, the data model includes a header that is comparable to the TEI header, and TEI and EAD naming conventions and tag structures have been used whenever feasible. However, while some feature names are similar, or even the same, it is important to recognize that MEI and TEI have different semantic scope. Obviously, a note element in MEI does not carry the same meaning as the element of the same name in TEI. Perhaps less obviously, a phrase in music notation is unrelated to a textual phrase. With respect to metadata, MEI recognizes the close relationship between the metadata content found in the MEI header and that of catalog records, authority records, and finding aids. Therefore MEI provides ways of indicating in the encoding the corresponding fields of other metadata standards. To ensure broad international and multi-repertoire application of MEI, existing musical terminology was used in building the data model where practical. When appropriate, a more neutral terminology was used to facilitate sharing of concepts and thus stressing the commonalities between different repertoires. Finally, extensive use of attributes and clearly-defined classification mechanisms in the schema permits the refinement of element meanings within specific musical, geographic, or temporal contexts.","url":"content\/introduction.html#structuralFeatures","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 Control and Maintenance","desc":"","remarks":"The Music Encoding Initiative Community has given itself By-laws , which regulate all essential properties and procedures.

In 1965, Milton Babbitt distinguished between graphemic , acoustic and auditory aspects of music (Babbitt, Milton: The Use of Computers in Musicological Research , in: Perspectives of New Music 3\/2 (1965), p. 76). Various music encoding formats took up this distinction, most notably SMDL, the Standard Music Description Language (ISO\/IEC DIS 10743). While the format itself was hardly ever used for its impractical implementation details, parts of its design certainly influenced the development of other formats, including MEI. In a documentation draft ( http:\/\/xml.coverpages.org\/smdl10743-pdf.gz, p.5 ), SMDL identifies four different musical domains : logical domain The logical domain is the basic musical content – the essence from which all performances and editions of the work are derived, including virtual time values, nominal pitches, etc. The logical domain is describable as “the composer’s intentions with respect to pitches, rhythms, harmonies, dynamics, tempi, articulations, accents, etc.,” and it is the primary focus of SMDL. It can also be described as “the abstract information common to both the gestural and visual domains.” […] gestural domain The gestural domain is comprised of any number of performances, each of which may specify how and when components of the logical domain is rendered in a specific performance, including all the means whereby the performer actually “expresses” (acoustically instantiates) the music (intonation, agogic and dynamic stress, etc.). The gestural domain is perhaps most succinctly described as “the information added by performers,” or “how the music actually sounds during particular performances.” […] visual domain The visual domain is comprised of any number of scores, each of which somehow specifies exactly how components of the logical domain is rendered visually in some particular printable (and\/or displayable) edition, including such graphical details as symbology, symbol sets, fonts, page layout, beaming conventions and exceptions, etc. The visual domain is perhaps most succinctly described as “the information added by human editors, engravers, and typesetters,” or “how the music actually looks in some particular edition.” […] analytical domain The analytical domain is comprised of any number of theoretical analyses and\/or commentaries, each of which somehow specifies opinions, exegeses, etc. about any or all of the information in the other three domains. […] On a generic level, MEI follows the same definition, and it definitely shares the same terminology. However, not all four domains are available throughout the MEI schema, and quite frequently, two domains fall together in MEI. Very often, MEI prioritizes the visual domain over the gestural domain by (partly) conflating the logical and the visual domains . For example, MEI utilizes the pname (pitch name) attribute on notes to capture the written pitch of a note, whereas the sounding pitch may be described with the pname.ges attribute. Here, the logical and visual domains go without a special indication, whereas the gestural domain is identified by a special suffix. However, in case of transposing instruments, additional markup (namely the attributes trans.diat and trans.semi from MEI’s attribute class att.staffDef.log ) will create a distinction between the logical and visual domain (see chapter ). In that case, pname will be restricted to the visual domain, while the logical aforementioned attributes provide additional information for the logical domain. Even though the technical implementation of MEI prioritizes the visual domain to some degree, this does not mean that any given encoding has to provide visual information. MEI takes no assumption on what data is required: While an OMR project ( optical music recognition ) may generate strictly visually oriented data only, another project focussed on audio transcriptions may generate gestural data only. A third project could integrate both approaches. In order to avoid ambiguous encodings, MEI is very strict and specific on the scope of its individual markup elements. For an encoder, the suffixes mentioned above provide clear hints on which domain is addressed by specific markup: Many attributes carry a suffixed .log (logical), .ges (gestural), .vis (visual), or .anl (analytical) in their name. In addition, the internal structure of MEI heavily relies on those different domains. When customizing MEI (see chapter ), it is possible to turn off either visual or gestural domain encoding completely. That way, MEI allows to address the four most eminent musical domains specifically and independent of each other.","url":"content\/introduction.html#musicalDomains","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 Events and Controlevents","desc":" note rest chord dynam tempo dir slur tie layer measure staff hairpin att.startId att.startEndId att.timestamp.log att.timestamp2.log","remarks":"MEI differentiates between two essential aspects of music notation: Events and ControlEvents . There are other examples for such a separation of concerns with regard to music. In Greg’s Copy-Text Theory (W.W. Greg: The Rationale of Copy-Text , 1950), a distinction between primary and secondary text is made; similar attempts have been made for music specifically. In MEI, elements describing the basic musical text are referred to as Events . They are the building blocks for the stream of music – mostly those are note s, rest s, and chord s. In contrast, ControlEvents make no independent contribution to that flow of music. Instead, they provide additional information about the encoded Events , they control their performance. Examples for such ControlEvents are dynam ic markings, tempo s indications, or performance dir ectives. Depending on the encoding strategy used, slur s and tie s often also fall into this category (they may be encoded as attributes instead, in which case they become a property of the basic events). Simply put, Events describe what needs to be performed, and ControlEvents indicate how it needs to be performed. In ( -based) MEI, Events are nested inside a layer element, while ControlEvents are direct children of the first measure they apply to, following all staff elements there. These structural differences result in different markup concepts. As Events are encoded inside layer s, their semantic position inside the encoded work can be derived from their structural position – the measure, staff and layer they're nested in, and within that layer by their position inside the sequence of all layer children. As mentioned above, it is highly recommended to encode ControlEvents inside the first measure they apply to, but they still require references to the actual events they apply to. There are two common concepts to provide such a connection, both of which offering specific benefits and drawbacks. A technically very stable connection between ControlEvents and Events can be established by using pointers . In this case, all events that need to be referenced need an xml:id attribute, which holds a globally unique identifier for this very element. The referencing controlevent then uses a startid and, if necessary, endid attribute to create a link to where in the stream of music it is supposed to start or end. The dynam element uses startid to reference the xml:id of the second quarter in the given measure <measure n=\"10\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <note pname=\"f\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\"\/> <note pname=\"g\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\" xml:id=\"c4ded06ff\"\/> <note pname=\"a\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\"\/> <note pname=\"c\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"4\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <dynam startid=\"#c4ded06ff\">f<\/dynam> <\/measure> In the example above, the dynam element references the second quarter in the given measure. Additional attributes like place may be used to describe the position of the forte indication within the score. A hairpin element may use the endid attribute to indicate the duration of the hairpin using the same mechanism as above. A ControlEvent encoded like above will be strictly tied to the referenced Events – if their position inside the XML document changes for whatever reason, they will keep that connection. This means that the semantic position to which they are bound may change without affecting the binding. An example could be an inserted additional note in front – the dynamic marking would not start on the second quarter, but perhaps on the third instead. As this behavior may not be desired in all cases, an alternative binding between ControlEvents and Events is possible, relying on timestamps instead. This mechanism is illustrated in the following example: The dynam element uses staff , layer and tstamp to indicate the place of the dynamic <measure n=\"10\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note pname=\"f\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\"\/> <note pname=\"g\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\"\/> <note pname=\"a\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\"\/> <note pname=\"c\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"4\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <dynam staff=\"1\" layer=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\">f<\/dynam> <\/measure> Here, no xml:id is required on notes. Instead, the dynam element uses the staff and layer attributes to indicate to which set of events the following tstamp attribute refers to. This mechanism actually depends on what has been only recommended above: placing the controlevent inside the measure where it starts. The startid reference mechanism would work equally well if all controlevents where positioned in the very first or last measure, or actually even inside a separate file. The tstamp references however would not, they depend on correct placement of the controlevents inside the XML tree. For consistency, it is therefore recommended to always use this placement. The benefit of this concept is that controlevents are tied to a semantic position , but not necessarily to a given XML element. The forte may still be placed on the second quarter, even though the composer may have replaced that quarter G4 with a different pitch and \/ or duration. Actually, it is not required that an Event can be found at the position indicated by a timestamp. This may be useful to encode a slur ending at an arbitrary position between two events, or dynam markings spread across otherwise empty measures. If the ending of a ControlEvent shall be given by timestamp, the tstamp2 attribute is used. Because of potential inconsistencies, an encoding should not offer both startid and tstamp or endid and tstamp2 . Though not being recommendable, it is possible to mix startid with tstamp2 and tstamp with endid . In general, it is easier for software to process startid and endid . When no other arguments apply, using xml:id -based pointers is therefore the most common way to connect ControlEvents with Events . The details on how timestamps are calculated and used in MEI are given in .","url":"content\/introduction.html#eventsControlevents","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 Timestamps in MEI","desc":" slur att.timestamp.log att.timestamp2.log","remarks":"In MEI, timestamps are treated in a slightly simplified way: they have no notion of beat . Instead, timestamps rely solely on the numbers given in the meter signature. In a measure of 4\/4, timestamps will range from 1 to 4. The second eighth note will be 1.5 in this case. If the same measure would be given in 2\/2, it would be 1.25 instead. At this point, MEI uses real numbers only to express timestamps. In case of (nested or complex) tuplets, this solution is inferior to fractions because of rounding errors. It is envisioned to introduce a fraction-based value for timestamps in a future revision of MEI. For now, it is recommended to round the fractional part of the number to no more than five digits to avoid such problems. Durations may also be expressed based on timestamps. In this case, the values are a combination of the count of measures that need to be moved forward to reach the measure in which an encoded feature ends, and the timestamp within that measure. The encoding contains a number of slur examples illustrating durations expressed by timestamps <!-- slur starting on timestamp 1, ending on timestamp 4 of the same measure --> <slur tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"0m+4\"\/> <!-- slur ending on timestamp 1 of the following measure --> <slur tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"1m+1\"\/> <!-- slur ending on timestamp 2.5 in the second next measure --> <slur tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"2m+2.5\"\/> Sometimes, timestamps are used to indicate positions where no music Events are located (see ). Therefore, the allowed range of timestamps stretches from 0 to the current meter count + 1. By definition, a timestamp of 0 indicates the position of the left bar line, while a timestamp of 5 (in case of a 4\/4 meter) indicates the right bar line. This makes it possible to encode open-ended slurs in a graphical way. However, it should be kept in mind that such timestamps may not be converted to startid and endid , and not every application may be able to render them correctly, even though they are perfectly valid MEI, and sometimes are necessary to faithfully transcribe a source.","url":"content\/introduction.html#timestamps","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 MEI Profiles","desc":"","remarks":"MEI is an encoding framework, not a data format. This means that MEI provides recommendations for encoding music documents, but it depends on the encoder's needs and requirements to which features and solutions are appropriate to the task and should be used. MEI offers specific models for different notation types and music repertoires, but it is rarely advisable to use them all side by side in one encoding. In order to use MEI, it is advised to use a restricted version of the schema, which will make it easier both for an encoder and a reader of the encoded files. MEI provides a number of pre-defined profiles , which focus on specific uses of MEI while still maintaining a great level of flexibility. For projects that need even better control over their data, it is highly recommended to create a more specific customized version of MEI (see chapter ). The following customizations are provided with every release of MEI: mei-CMN For most users, this will be the best starting point into music encoding with MEI. The mei-CMN customization targets at documents that use Common Western Music Notation . The specific rules for that notation are specified in chapter , even though other chapters of these Guidelines apply as well. mei-Mensural For documents written in Mensural Notation (both black and white), MEI offers the mei-Mensural customization. The specific rules for that notation are specified in chapter , even though other chapters of these Guidelines apply as well. mei-Neumes This profile allows to encode medieval Neume Notation with MEI. The specific rules for that notation are specified in chapter , even though other chapters of these Guidelines apply as well. Please note that the mei-Neumes profile has undergone significant changes from MEI version 3 to version 4. mei-Basic As an encoding framework, MEI offers multiple approaches to encode certain features at various levels of detail. While this flexibility is at the core of MEI and often required for research projects, it is an obstacle when developing software and converters for MEI. The mei-Basic profile is a subset of MEI which restricts it to one way of encoding for every feature of music notation. It covers Common Western Music Notation only, and excludes all editorial markup. In essence, it has the same functionality as most other music encoding formats like MusicXML or MNX. The purpose of mei-Basic is to serve as common ground for data interchange, both between projects using different profiles of MEI, and other encoding schemes. mei-all This is the full definition of MEI. It includes all different repertoires, which has certain side effects and enables encoding options that are neither intended nor advocable. For example, in mensural notation music is organized by staves. In contrast, Common Music Notation utilizes measures, which in turn contain staves. These staves have a different meaning here, and are modeled differently in MEI. mei-all mixes those models and thus invites encoding errors. In general, you should almost never use mei-all except for testing purposes. mei-all_anyStart This profile includes all of mei-all , but extends it even further so that it allows any MEI element as root of conforming MEI instances. In regular MEI, the only allowed starting elements are mei , meiHead , music and meiCorpus . The sole purpose of this customization is to simplify validation at tutorial sessions and other educational purposes. It should not be used in production. The first three profiles provide good starting points to encode music from the respective repertoires. They may also serve as template for further, project-specific customizations. The latter two profiles target very specific use cases and should not be used by default.","url":"content\/introduction.html#meiProfiles","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1.1 Customizing MEI","desc":"","remarks":"In production, it is best to use a customized version of MEI, restricted to the very needs of a project. Such a custom schema will guide the encoders and will help to ensure consistency and data quality throughout a project’s files. A customization typically provides a subset of MEI’s encoding models (typically starting from one of the official profiles mentioned in chapter ), with only one solution for any given situation being allowed. The customization will help to reflect the scope of a project into its data: Only those aspects of music notation a project is interested in will be allowed, so that the absence of a specific information can not be misunderstood as an oversight of the encoders. Larger editorial projects like Complete Works editions typically use Editorial Guidelines (german: Editionsrichtlinien ) for the same purposes: (internal) quality control and (external) documentation. In that sense, MEI customizations may serve as Editorial Guidelines in digital form. MEI is implemented in ODD. ODD, or One Document Does-it-all , is another XML-based markup language developed and maintained by the TEI. TEI's documentation for ODD can be found in the TEI Guidelines chapter 22: Documentation Elements , chapter 23: Using the TEI , and the \" Getting Started with P5 ODDs \" document. At this point, there is no specific documentation on how to customize MEI with ODD beyond the generic TEI documentation. However, the provided are based on ODD customizations, and may serve as starting point for further project-specific restrictions. They can be found at https:\/\/github.com\/music-encoding\/music-encoding\/tree\/stable\/customizations . In addition, several projects have shared their customizations on GitHub, such as Freischütz Digital or Beethovens Werkstatt . MEI provides a web service at http:\/\/custom.music-encoding.org which allows to compile such customizations against the MEI sources in order to generate RelaxNG schemata, which can be used for validation. More documentation on customizing MEI will be provided as time permits; until then, it is recommended to reach out to the MEI Community for additional assistance.","url":"content\/introduction.html#meiCustomization","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"1.1 Sample Encodings and Tools for MEI","desc":"","remarks":"The Music Encoding Initiative provides a collection of sample encodings, which demonstrate a wide-range of uses of MEI in real-world contexts.

It is used as a structural unit inside section elements and acts as a container for ‘events’ from the model.eventLike class, such as notes, chords and rests as well as ‘control events’ from the model.controlEventLike class, such as slurs and indications of dynamics. The following example demonstrates the use of the measure element: <section> <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <chord dur=\"1\"> <note oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"\/> <\/chord> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer> <note dur=\"1\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <\/section> A measure slices the flow of a score or part into chunks that normally comply with a duration determined by the meter defined within a preceding scoreDef or staffDef element. Each staff in the source material is represented by a staff element. As the order of the staff elements in the file does not have to reflect their order in the original document, to eliminate confusion they should always refer to a staffDef element, using either an n or def attribute. Whereas the def attribute uses the xs:anyURI datatype, the n value refers to the closest preceding staffDef or layerDef with the same value in its n attribute. <staffDef n=\"3\" xml:id=\"cmn_staffDef1\" \/> <!-- later in the file: --> <staff def=\"#cmn_staffDef1\"> <!-- @def refers to staffDef with this identifier --> <!-- staff content --> <\/staff> <!-- or: --> <staff n=\"3\"> <!-- @n refers to staffDef with this numeric label --> <!-- staff content --> <\/staff> Each staff may hold a number of layer elements to reflect multiple ‘voices’. Just as with staff , the order of the layer elements in the file does not have to reflect their original order in the document, so they also possess n and def attributes for association with the appropriate layer definition. <staffDef> <layerDef n=\"1\" xml:id=\"cmn_layerDef1\"\/> <\/staffDef> Later in the file: <section xml:id=\"cmn_staffDef1\"> <staff def=\"#cmn_staffDef1\"> <layer def=\"#cmn_layerDef1\"> <!-- layer content --> <\/layer> <\/staff> <!-- OR: --> <staff n=\"3\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <!-- layer content --> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/section>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnMeasures","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1 Defining Score Parameters for CMN","desc":" scoreDef keySig staffDef staffGrp layerDef label labelAbbr score part staff measure layer att.meterSigDefault.log att.keySigDefault.log att.pages att.systems att.textStyle att.notationStyle att.lyricStyle att.cleffing.log clef clefGrp keyAccid meterSig meterSigGrp","remarks":"When encoding a score in CMN, MEI relies on the following elements from the module: A scoreDef element is used to specify the common parameters of a score, e.g. , key and meter. The most important attributes for this purpose are: The following example describes a score in common time with 3 flats: <scoreDef keysig=\"3f\" meter.count=\"4\" meter.sym=\"common\" meter.unit=\"4\"\/> For encoding more complex time signatures, simple mathematical symbols such as asterisks and plus signs are allowed in meter.count . Non-standard key signatures have to be encoded with a keySig element. Other attributes allow the description of default page and system margins and fonts for text and music: There are other attributes that allow the specification of many further details of a score. These are available from the element definitions accessible at scoreDef , staffDef , staffGrp and layerDef . When content is provided for scoreDef , it must contain a staffGrp element. This element is used to gather individual staves and other staff groups. This is useful for collecting instrumental or vocal groups in a large score, such as woodwinds, brasses, etc., and for assigning a shared label to the group, using the label and labelAbbr subelements. The staffGrp element is also used for the two staves of a grand staff. The bar.thru attribute on staffGrp allows one to specify whether bar lines are drawn across the space between staves of that group or only on the staves themselves. A staffDef element is used to describe an individual staff of a score or performer part . It bears most of the attributes described above. The label and labelAbbr subelements may be used for providing staff labels for the first and subsequent systems. Every staffDef must have an n attribute with an integer as its value. The first occurrence of a staffDef with a given number must also indicate the number of staff lines via the lines attribute. The order of staffDef elements within scoreDef follows the order of staves in the source document or planned rendering. The individual staff elements within a measure refer to these staffDef declarations using their own n attribute values. Therefore, the encoding order of staves within a measure does not have to mimic the order of the staffDef elements with scoreDef . In addition to the parameters inherited from scoreDef , the following attributes are important for staffDef elements: A staff with a tenor clef is encoded as in the following example: <staffDef clef.dis=\"8\" clef.dis.place=\"below\" clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\"\/> In the case of transposing instruments, the key-related attributes described above may be used to override the written key expressed in the scoreDef element. As a basic principle, MEI always captures written pitches, so the trans.diat and trans.semi attributes may be used to indicate the number of diatonic steps and semitones to calculate sounded pitch from written pitch. The piccolo and E♭ clarinet staves in the example below utilize these attributes: <scoreDef meter.count=\"6\" meter.unit=\"8\"> <staffGrp> <!-- Piccolo sounds 12 semitones higher than written (and encoded in MEI). --> <staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.mode=\"major\" keysig=\"4f\" label=\"Piccolo\" label.abbr=\"Picc.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"1\" trans.diat=\"0\" trans.semi=\"12\" xml:id=\"cmn.P1\"\/> <staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.mode=\"major\" keysig=\"4f\" label=\"Flute\" label.abbr=\"Fl.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"2\" xml:id=\"cmn.P2\"\/> <staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.mode=\"major\" keysig=\"4f\" label=\"Oboe\" label.abbr=\"Ob.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"3\" xml:id=\"cmn.P3\"\/> <staffDef clef.line=\"4\" clef.shape=\"F\" key.mode=\"major\" keysig=\"4f\" label=\"Bassoon\" label.abbr=\"Bsn.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"4\" xml:id=\"cmn.P4\"\/> <!-- Clarinet sounds a minor third (two diatonic steps or three semitones) higher than written. --> <staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" key.mode=\"major\" keysig=\"1f\" label=\"Clarinet in E♭\" label.abbr=\"E♭ Cl.\" lines=\"5\" n=\"5\" trans.diat=\"2\" trans.semi=\"3\" xml:id=\"cmn.P5\"\/> <\/staffGrp> <\/scoreDef> There are a number of additional elements that can be used as children of staffDef in order to describe additional features of the staff, such as the color of a clef or a key signature added in a different hand. These elements include: With the exception of label , these elements may also occur within the flow of musical events captured in a layer , since they are members of model.eventLike . In the layer context they function as milestones and affect all following content assigned to the layer (even in subsequent measures) until their information is again overridden either by the same element bearing different information or a staffDef or scoreDef . In this context, it is also possible to combine them with the elements described in chapters and of these Guidelines. Such flexibility as this may require close inspection of an encoding to retrieve the correct definitions for a given staff. As a general rule, the closest preceding and most specific element provides this information: For example, a keySig in the preceding measure is more relevant than a staffDef at the beginning of the section, which is more relevant than a scoreDef at the beginning of the score. However, a section-specific scoreDef that provides only information about the meter does not override the more specific information about key signature gathered from a staffDef for a transposing instrument. Every staffDef may contain a number of layerDef elements, which may be used to establish default values for the distinct layers sharing one staff. MEI does not use the term ‘voice’ to describe these ‘musical threads’ because that term implies continuity across measure boundaries. Given the sometimes arbitrary relationships between these threads from measure to measure as well as across staves, MEI uses the more neutral term ‘layer’.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnDefs","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1 Special cases in staff definitions","desc":" clef key meterSig layerDef meterSigGrp","remarks":"Usually clef , key , and meterSig apply to a whole staff. In some rare cases one can find different meters in different layers, as seen in Maurice Ravel’s Oiseaux tristes .

Re-definition of Score Parameters","desc":" staffDef scoreDef","remarks":"Sometimes it is necessary to re-define the parameters of a score or a staff. For example, a score may change keys, the number of staves, or use different layout settings. Likewise, a staff may change its clef, change the number of layers, or become invisible. To accommodate these changes, staffDef is allowed to occur in the following locations: within the description of staff groups; that is, in staffGrp , within the content of a measure , between measures; that is, directly within section and ending elements, and between sections and endings; that is, directly within a score or part element. In addition, scoreDef is allowed to occur: within sections and endings; that is, inside section and ending elements; and between sections and endings; that is, directly within a score or part . It is also possible to include scoreDef and staffDef in staves and layers when the MEI All schema is in use; however, this practice is not recommended for the CMN repertoire.

The value for oct changes between B and C, that is, octave ranges go from C, D, …, G, A, to B. For example, middle C or c' (the C in the middle, i.e. , fourth C key from left, on a standard 88-key piano keyboard) is represented on the first ledger line in G clef notation and labelled as C4 , in the naming convention of SPN. The note one semitone below would be labelled B3 , and A4 would refer to the first A above C4 . The usual CMN-specific values for dur are: 1 whole note 2 half note 4 quarter note 8 eighth note 16 sixteenth note … 2048 2048th note Additionally, the following two values borrowed from mensural notation are allowed, as they sometimes also appear in CMN: breve double whole long quadruple whole Please note that their mensural counterparts bear different names in order to clearly distinguish between repertoires. Dotted durational values are accommodated by the dots attribute, which records the number of written augmentation dots.

Therefore, the dur attribute records only the written rhythmic value of the grace note. The time necessary for the performance of grace notes can be unspecified, calculated based on taking time from other non-grace notes, or specified precisely using the dur.ges attribute. The values of grace indicate from which note time is ‘borrowed’ to perform the grace note: The preceding note, in which case the value unacc (unaccented) is used, or the following note, when the value acc (accented) is appropriate. Technically, this value determines if the note following the grace will keep its original onset time or will be slightly delayed to allow the grace note itself to be accented. Sometimes it is not clear how to perform a grace; in these situations the value unknown allows one to indicate a grace note while unambiguously stating that its performed duration remains unknown. The grace.time attribute is only to be used in combination with the grace attribute. It records the amount of time (as a percentage of the written duration) that the grace note should ‘steal’ from the preceding note (when grace =\"unacc\") or the following note (when grace =\"acc\"). Grace notes can be placed within a graceGrp element, which itself allows all values for grace as explained above. The optional attach attribute is used to record whether the grace note group is attached to the following event or to the preceding one. The graceGrp element can be used with single or multiple grace notes.

The following values are allowed: 1slash 1 slash through stem 2slash 2 slashes through stem 3slash 3 slashes through stem 4slash 4 slashes through stem 5slash 5 slashes through stem 6slash 6 slashes through stem sprech X placed on stem z Z placed on stem The stem.mod attibute is normally used in accordance with practices described in section . The CMN module makes the att.stems.cmn attribute class available, which adds the optional stem.with attribute to note and chord . The attribute stem.with allows for the indication of a stem that joins notes on adjacent staves. Cross-staff chord The following code demonstrates one method of encoding the first chord in the last measure in the image above. The stem.with attribute must occur on all the notes or chords attached to the cross-staff stem. <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" stem.with=\"below\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <chord dur=\"2\" stem.with=\"above\"> <note accid=\"n\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\"\/> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\"\/> <\/chord> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> Alternatively, the encoder may choose to treat the notes in the lower staff as logically belonging to the top staff and to ‘displace’ them using the staff attribute on note . Some use cases, however, may require filling the time that those notes would normally occupy using the space element described in section . Using this mechanism, the example above could also be encoded like so: <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <chord dur=\"2\"> <note oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\"\/> <note accid=\"n\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" staff=\"2\"\/> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" staff=\"2\"\/> <\/chord> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <!-- the time used by the notes on staff 2 filled with non-sounding \"space\" --> <space dur=\"2\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> The choice between these two methods of representing material that crosses staves is often software-dependent. Whereas stem.with can be used to define stems that connect notes across different staves (cross-staff chords) stem.sameas is meant for describing a stem that connects two notes pertaining to different layers within the same staff. The typical scenario for stem.sameas is orchestral scores where two wind instruments are notated on one single staff. Normally, the notes have individual stems pointing in opposite directions. However, it is common engraving practice that notes of the same duration are often stemmed together between the parts encoded in separate layers. The following example demonstrates this practice in the wind instruments (bassoons and trumpets in meas. 1 - 3, horns in meas. 3) Shared stems The following code represents an encoding of shared stems in the bassoon and trumpet staff using stem.sameas . <score> <measure n=\"1\"> <!-- ... --> <staff label=\"Fagotti\" n=\"3\"> <layer n=\"1\" xml:id=\"L08\"> <note accid.ges=\"f\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" tstamp=\"1\" xml:id=\"note_2754\"\/> <note accid.ges=\"f\" dots=\"2\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" tstamp=\"2\" xml:id=\"note_2757\"\/> <note accid.ges=\"f\" dur=\"16\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" tstamp=\"2.875\" xml:id=\"note_2760\"\/> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\" xml:id=\"L10\"> <note accid.ges=\"f\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\" stem.sameas=\"#note_2754\" tstamp=\"1\" xml:id=\"note_2766\"\/> <note accid.ges=\"f\" dots=\"2\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\" stem.sameas=\"#note_2757\" tstamp=\"2\" xml:id=\"note_2769\"\/> <note accid.ges=\"f\" dur=\"16\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"e\" stem.sameas=\"#note_2760\" tstamp=\"2.875\" xml:id=\"note_2772\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <!-- ... --> <staff label=\"Clarini\" n=\"5\"> <layer n=\"1\" xml:id=\"L15\"> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" tstamp=\"1\" xml:id=\"note_2808\"\/> <note dots=\"2\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" tstamp=\"2\" xml:id=\"note_2811\"\/> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" tstamp=\"2.875\" xml:id=\"note_2814\"\/> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\" xml:id=\"L17\"> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" stem.sameas=\"#note_2808\" tstamp=\"1\" xml:id=\"note_2820\"\/> <note dots=\"2\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" stem.sameas=\"#note_2811\" tstamp=\"2\" xml:id=\"note_2823\"\/> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" stem.sameas=\"#note_2814\" tstamp=\"2.875\" xml:id=\"note_2826\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <!-- ... --> <\/measure> <\/score>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnChordsStems","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1.1 Rests","desc":" rest note chord mRest multiRest mSpace","remarks":"The dur attribute on rest captures the written duration of the rest and allows the same values as on note and chord .

The most common and most musician-friendly approach to this is through the use of a combination of the attributes tstamp and dur , which are made available by the attribute classes att.timestamp.log (inherited by att.controlEvent ) and att.timestamp2.log , both from the shared module. The timestamp ( tstamp ) of a musical event is calculated in relation to the meter of the current measure and resembles the so-called ‘beat’ position. In a common time measure with four quarter notes, the timestamp of each quarter equals its beat position in the measure: The first quarter has a timestamp of 1, the second has a timestamp of 2, and so on. MEI defines the value of tstamp as a real number; the second eighth note position in a measure would thus be represented by the value of \"1.5\". The range of possible values is defined as starting with zero and ending with the number of metrical units in a measure (the ‘numerator’ in a time signature) + 1. This allows the capture of all graphical positions starting from the left bar line ('0') and ending with the right bar line of the measure ('5', in the case of 4\/4 time). For expressing durations, MEI offers the dur attribute. This attribute is described in section . For ‘spanning’ elements like slurs, which are members of the model.controlEventLike class, it is often more intuitive to record two timestamps – one for the onset of the event and one for its termination. Because the termination of the event may be in a succeeding measure, the second timestamp ( tstamp2 ) has a slightly different datatype than the one marking the initiation of the event. Its datatype is constrained to values following the formula \" xm + y \", where x is the number of full measures that this particular feature lasts (or the number of bar lines crossed) and y is the timestamp in the target measure where the feature ends. The timestamp is expressed using the same logic as described above. For example, a value of \"0m+3\" in 4\/4 time indicates that the element bearing this attribute, a slur for example, ends on beat 3 of the same measure where it started. A value of \"1m+1.5\" would indicate an end on the second eighth note of the following measure. In 6\/8 time, the value \"2m+3\" means that the feature ends two measures later on the third eighth note.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnTstamp","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1 Advanced CMN Features","desc":"","remarks":"Over time, in addition to the basic features of note, chord, and rest, many other symbols have been added to CMN.

MEI provides two elements for the explicit encoding of features joined by beams. Use of the beam element is straightforward. The beamed notes, rests, or chords are simply enclosed by the beam element: <layer> <beam> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <\/beam> <\/layer> Whereas in music notation every note value shorter than an eighth adds another beam (sometimes referred to as ‘secondary beams’), in MEI only one beam element is used, no matter the durations of the contained notes. The visual rendition of a set of beamed notes is presumed to be handled by rendering processes. <layer> <!-- … --> <beam> <note dur=\"16\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"16\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <\/beam> <!-- … --> <\/layer> From the 19th century onwards, it became quite common to break secondary beams to increase readability of longer beamed passages. The optional breaksec attribute on note s and chord s under the beam may be used to encode the breaking of secondary beams after the note or chord bearing the attribute. The value of breaksec indicates the number of continuous beams. For example: Primary and secondary beams <layer> <beam> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"16\"\/> <\/beam> <beam> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note breaksec=\"1\" dur=\"16\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <\/beam> <\/layer> In the music of the second half of the 20th century, it is quite common to indicate acceleration or deceleration using converging (feathered) beams as in the image below: The encoding of such a beam is accomplished using the form attribute of the beam, which allows the following values: acc Beams gradually diverge. rit Beams gradually converge (into one). mixed Beams diverge and converge arbitrarily. norm The beam is rendered as usual (default). <layer> <!-- … --> <beam form=\"acc\"> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <\/beam> <!-- … --> <\/layer> The duration of notes, rests, or chords under a beam which carries the form attribute with a value of ‘acc’, ‘rit’, or ‘mixed’ must be treated specially. The first and last contained elements must specify a duration which matches the number of beams displayed at the point of these events. In the case of a ‘mixed’ beam, each event at the point of change in the number of secondary beams must carry a dur attribute. Beams like this may be encoded thusly: Feathered beaming <layer> <!-- … --> <beam form=\"mixed\"> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <\/beam> <beam form=\"mixed\"> <note dur=\"32\"\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note\/> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"8\"\/> <\/beam> <!-- … --> <\/layer> Two measures from No. 4 of Moszkowski’s 12 Pianoforte Studies for the left hand Beams that connect events on different staves may be encoded in two different ways. First, a single-layer approach may be taken that treats the events lying under the beam as logically belonging to the same layer as the initial event but visually ‘displaced’ to an adjacent staff. In the example above from Moritz Moszkowski’s 12 Pianoforte Studies for the left hand , Op. 92, MoszWV 117 this method makes even from a semantic perspective perfect sense. It can be achieved with an additional staff attribute value that contradicts the ‘normal’ staff placement indicated by the n attribute of their ancestor staff . <staff n=\"2\"> <layer> <!-- … --> <beam place=\"mixed\"> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" accid.ges=\"s\"\/> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\"\/> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" accid=\"s\" staff=\"1\"\/> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" accid.ges=\"s\" staff=\"1\"\/> <\/beam> <!-- … --> <\/layer> <\/staff> In other contexts however, a staff-by-staff methodology may be employed in which the notes are encoded according to the staff on which they appear. This encoding style requires that each beam element account for the total time encompassed by the beam; that is, each beam must use one or more space elements to account for the time occupied by notes on the opposing staff. For example, the time used by the first two notes of the beam must be represented on staff number 1 and the time taken by the last two notes of the beam must be filled on staff number 2. <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <beam beam.with=\"below\"> <space dur=\"8\"\/> <note oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\"\/> <note pname=\"f\"\/> <\/beam> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer> <beam beam.with=\"above\"> <note dur=\"16\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note pname=\"b\"\/> <space dur=\"8\"\/> <\/beam> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> Downstream processing needs are the determining factor in the choice between the two alternative encoding methods. Due to the potential problem of overlapping hierarchies, the beam element only allows the encoding of beams that do not cross bar lines. When beams cross bar lines, the use of the beamSpan element is required. Unlike beam , the beamSpan element does not contain the beamed notes as its children. Instead, it references the xml:id values of all affected notes in its plist attribute and denotes the initial and terminal notes of the beam using startid and endid attributes. This configuration allows beams to cross measure boundaries. The following example from Erwin Schulhoff’s Violin Sonata demonstrates a typical example of such hierarchy-crossing beams: Cross-measure beam in the third movement of Schulhoff’s Sonata <beamSpan startid=\"#note1\" endid=\"#note4\" plist=\"#note1 #note2 #note3 #note4\"\/> In addition to the explicit encoding of beams accommodated by the beam and beamSpan elements and the beam attribute, MEI allows for specification of default beaming behavior using the following attributes on scoreDef , staffDef , and layerDef : beam.group Provides an example of how automated beaming (including secondary beams) is to be performed. beam.rests Indicates whether automatically-drawn beams should include rests shorter than a quarter note duration. The beam.group attribute can be used to set a default beaming pattern to be used when no beaming is indicated at the layer level. It must contain a comma-separated list of time values that add up to a measure in the current meter, e.g. , 4,4,4,4 in 4\/4 time indicates that each quarter note worth of shorter notes should be beamed together. Parentheses can be used to indicate sub-groupings of secondary beams. For example, (4.,4.,4.) in 9\/8 meter indicates one primary beam per measure with secondary beams broken at each dotted quarter duration, while (4,4),(4,4) in 4\/4 will result in a measure of 16th notes being rendered with a primary beam covering all the notes and secondary beams for each group of four 16th notes. The beam.group attribute is available on scoreDef , staffDef , and layerDef elements, making it possible to set different beaming patterns for each of these. Also, the beaming pattern can be changed anywhere score parameters may be changed, for example, at the start of sections. This beaming \"directive\" can be overridden by using beam , beamSpan , or beam attributes as described above. If none of these beaming specifications is used, then no beaming is implied. Default beaming can be explicitly ‘turned off’ by setting beam.group to an empty string.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnBeams","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1 Ties, Slurs and Phrase Marks","desc":" note chord layer tie slur phrase measure","remarks":"One of the most specific features of CMN is the use of ‘curved lines’ which connect notes. These lines are used to indicate various musical features, depending on their context. A tie is a curved line connecting two notes of the same pitch . The purpose of a tie is to join the durations of both notes, so that the first note sounds for the combined duration. In other words, there is only one onset for both notes. In MEI, ties can be encoded in different ways, depending on the level of detail that the encoder wants to preserve. The simplest solution is to use the tie attribute found on note and chord . <layer> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"i\"\/> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"t\"\/> <\/layer> This attribute allows three values: i (initial) Marks the start of a tie m (medial) Marks a participant in a tie other than the first or last t (terminal) Marks the end of a tie The scope of the tie attribute is the musical layer ; that is, a tie started in one layer may only be ended by a subsequent musical event with a tie attribute with an m or t value in the same layer. The tie-terminating event may lie in the following measure. Ties across bar lines <measure n=\"1\"> <!-- staff 1 omitted --> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <chord dur=\"16\"> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"f\" \/> <note oct=\"1\" pname=\"f\" \/> <\/chord> <beam> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"i\" \/> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"a\" tie=\"i\" \/> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\" tie=\"i\" \/> <\/beam> <chord dur=\"4\"> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"i\" \/> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\" tie=\"m\" \/> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"a\" tie=\"m\" \/> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"m\" \/> <\/chord> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <measure n=\"2\"> <!-- staff 1 omitted --> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <chord dur=\"16\"> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"t\" \/> <note oct=\"3\" pname=\"c\" tie=\"t\" \/> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"a\" tie=\"t\" \/> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"f\" tie=\"t\" \/> <\/chord> <!-- … --> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <!-- measures 3 and 4 omitted --> When tie is used on chords, it functions as a shorthand indication for multiple tie markings; that is, a separate tie is drawn for every pitch in the chord that remains unchanged in the succeeding chord. <staff> <layer> <chord dur=\"4\" tie=\"i\"> <note pname=\"f\"\/> <note pname=\"c\"\/> <note pname=\"a\"\/> <\/chord> <chord dur=\"4\" tie=\"t\"> <note pname=\"f\"\/> <note pname=\"c\"\/> <note pname=\"a\"\/> <\/chord> <\/layer> <\/staff> This is equivalent to the following, more verbose version: <staff> <layer> <chord dur=\"4\"> <note pname=\"f\" tie=\"i\"\/> <note pname=\"c\" tie=\"i\"\/> <note pname=\"a\" tie=\"i\"\/> <\/chord> <chord dur=\"4\"> <note pname=\"f\" tie=\"t\"\/> <note pname=\"c\" tie=\"t\"\/> <note pname=\"a\" tie=\"t\"\/> <\/chord> <\/layer> <\/staff> A slur is a curved line that connects a group of notes of different pitch. It normally indicates that an instrument-specific performance technique should be applied to the affected notes. For example, in notation for winds, the notes should be played in one breath, while a single bow is indicated for string instruments. Slurs In MEI, slurs may be encoded in a similar way to ties: note and chord bear a slur attribute that allows the commencement or ending of a slur at this element. The allowed values, however, are slightly different: The i , m or t are followed by a single digit in the range 1 to 6, as in the following example: <layer> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" slur=\"i1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"m1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" slur=\"t1\"\/> <\/layer> The reason for this difference is that slurs, unlike ties, may overlap, so that a second slur may start while the first slur is still ongoing. The digit indicates the level of nesting of slurs on the note; ‘1’ indicates no nesting, while ‘2’ indicates the existence of 2 slurs in which this note participates, and so on. In the example below, the second and third quarter notes lie under 2 slurs. The second note is covered by the slur that begins on the preceding note and by the one that it starts. The third note is affected by the slur that begins on note one and by the one that starts on note two. <staff> <layer> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"i1\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" slur=\"i2\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"t2\"\/> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" slur=\"t1\"\/> <\/layer> <layer> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" slur=\"i1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" slur=\"t1\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> To support analytical operations, slur may take on more than one value. For example, the example above may be more explicitly encoded as: <staff> <layer> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"i1\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" slur=\"m1 i2\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"m1 t2\"\/> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" slur=\"t1\"\/> <\/layer> <layer> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\" slur=\"i1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" slur=\"t1\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> In this encoding, the notes in the beamed group are marked as participating in two slurs – one connecting just the beamed notes and one connecting the first and last notes of the layer. In ‘nested’ slurs like this, the function of the slurs is usually different. Here, the slur connecting the 8th notes indicates legato performance, while the longer slur functions as a phrase mark. While ties are not normally allowed to cross layers or staves, slurs may. The following example demonstrates how cross-staff slurs may be encoded using the slur attribute: <measure> <staff> <layer> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"i1\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" slur=\"m1\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" slur=\"m1\"\/> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" slur=\"m1\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <staff> <layer> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"2\" oct=\"3\" pname=\"b\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\" slur=\"t1\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> Slurs and ties that cross system or page breaks are often split into two separate symbols for rendering. One slur or tie ends at the last bar line, another one starts at the beginning of the new system. MEI expects this to be the default rendering behavior, so that in situations like these, the regular tie or slur attributes are sufficient to describe both curved lines resulting from the split. Sometimes, however, one of these two symbols is missing in the document, or the encoder wants to provide additional (often visual) information about the slur or tie. In these cases, using an attribute is not an adequate solution. Therefore, MEI offers dedicated tie and slur elements. A third element, phrase , is used to identify a unified melodic idea (in German: Phrasierungsbogen ), whereas the slur element is used as a generic element for all curved lines (in German: Bogensetzung ) except ties. All three elements have nearly identical models. Another reason for using elements instead of attributes for ties, slurs, and phrase marks is that only elements may be combined with the functionality provided in chapters and of these Guidelines. Although these elements are allowed within a layer to accommodate unmeasured notation, by convention in CMN they are normally placed inside measure , after the encoding of staves, alongside other so-called ‘control events’. <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <slur\/> <tempo\/> <dynam\/> <\/measure> Obviously, to be complete the slur in the above example needs to be ‘attached’ to the notes somehow. The ‘vertical assignment’ can be indicated for the example above using the staff and layer attributes like so: <slur layer=\"1\" staff=\"1\"\/> For the ‘horizontal assignment’, the encoder may choose between two different mechanisms. The first uses two timestamp attributes as described in section . The start and end points of the slur may be indicated thusly: <slur layer=\"1\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"0m+4\"\/> By using tstamp and tstamp2 attributes, the encoder denotes a rather loose connection – the slur (or tie) is attached to a certain position in the measure, not to a specific note or chord. If the encoder wants to specify a close connection to a particular event, the startid and endid attributes may be used instead. Here, the xml:id s of the first and last note of the slur are referenced. This mechanism also allows the crossing of layers and staves. For human readability, it is recommended to encode slur , tie and phrase features in the measure where they begin; that is, in the measure that holds the element referenced by startid . On the other hand, for machine processability, it may be desirable to place slur , tie , and phrase elements in the measure where they end or even in the last measure regardless of their beginning and ending points in the music. This last option makes all references contained within these elements ‘back references’. Back references are necessary when using processing software that treats the encoded file as a stream; that is, programs that process the file without creating an in-memory representation of its contents. When using the tie , slur or phrase elements, the curvature of the line may be described using the curvedir , bulge and bezier attributes. Whereas the first attribute allows only specification of the slur’s vertical placement, the others give increasingly more precise control of the curve. If the encoder wishes to draw attention to the appearance of a slur or tie in a given source, the facs attribute may be used instead of (or in addition to) the curve description attributes to point to a graphic image or a zone within an image (see ).","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnSlurTies","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1 Dynamics in CMN","desc":" dynam slur measure staff hairpin","remarks":"Common Music Notation provides two different methodologies for expressing the volume of a note, phrase, section, etc. The first is a verbal instruction providing such information in human language, possibly in an abbreviated form. An example is the word piano , indicating a quiet volume, often abbreviated as p . In MEI, verbal instructions like this are encoded using the dynam element from the Shared module (see chapter ): <dynam>p<\/dynam> By convention, dynam elements, like slur and other elements belonging to the model.controlEventLike class, are encoded at the end of the measure to which they belong. This requires dynam to be assigned to a certain staff using the staff attribute, whose value refers to the target element’s n attribute. In the absence of other information, all layers within the staff are assumed to have the same dynamic marking. <dynam staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\">p<\/dynam> However, when the layers of a staff have different dynamic indications, the layer attribute may be used to associate a dynamic marking with a particular layer: <measure> <dynam layer=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\">p<\/dynam> <dynam layer=\"2\" tstamp=\"1\">mf<\/dynam> <\/measure> A suitable MIDI value may be assigned to a dynamic marking using the val attribute: <dynam layer=\"1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"1\" val=\"84\">f<\/dynam> The location of a dynamic marking in relation to a staff may be specified using the place attribute, which may be given as above , below or within the staff or even between two staves: <dynam place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\">p<\/dynam> <!-- or --> <dynam place=\"between\" staff=\"1 2\" tstamp=\"2\">f<\/dynam> Dynamics must also be associated with a particular time point in a measure, using the tstamp , or with a particular event, using the startid attribute. Linking a control event with measures and events is discussed in section : <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" stem.mod=\"2slash\"\/> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\" stem.mod=\"2slash\"\/> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/layer> <\/staff> <dynam layer=\"1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"1\">p<\/dynam> <dynam layer=\"1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> <\/measure> Dynamics which do not have an explicit endpoint are often referred to as ‘instantaneous’. On the other hand, some dynamic directions indicate a continuous change that must have a defined end point. It is possible to specify the logical scope of continuous dynamic marks using the attributes tstamp2 , dur , dur.ges , or endid . Additionally a corresponding ending value for MIDI output may be given in the val2 attribute. To capture the fact that the crescendo in the example above continue until the first beat of the next measure, they may be marked: <!-- using the tstamp2 attribute --><dynam place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\" tstamp2=\"1m+1\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> <!-- using the endid attribute --><dynam endid=\"#ID_of_ending_note\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> Any combination of tstamp , startid , tstamp2 , and endid attributes may be used to define the scope of a dynamic, although the tstamp and tstamp2 or the startid and endid combinations are the most logical combinations. For example, the following alternatives are all possibilities for encoding up a crescendo. The choice of attributes is often task or processor dependent. <!-- tstamp attribute indicates starting point, dur attribute marks the end --><dynam place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\" dur=\"1\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> <!-- tstamp attribute indicates starting point, endid attribute marks the end --><dynam endid=\"#ID_of_last_note\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> <!-- startid attribute indicates starting point, tstamp2 attribute marks the end --><dynam place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" startid=\"#ID_of_first_note\" tstamp2=\"1m+3\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> <!-- startid attribute indicates starting point, endid attribute marks the end --><dynam endid=\"#ID_of_last_note\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" startid=\"#ID_of_first_note\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> All musical elements affected by the dynam may be explicitly specified using the plist attribute, which contains xml:id attribute value references: <dynam endid=\"#note4\" place=\"above\" plist=\"#note1 #note2 #note3 #note4\" staff=\"2\" startid=\"#note1\">cresc. poco a poco<\/dynam> It is recommended that the list of references in plist include all participants in the dynamic marking, including the first and last notes as in the preceding example, even though they are duplicated by startid and endid attributes. In addition to verbal instructions, Common Music Notation uses graphical symbols to indicate ‘continuous’ dynamics. These crescendo and decrescendo (or diminuendo) symbols are encoded in MEI using the hairpin element. It also is a member of the model.controlEventLike class, which means it too is used just before the close of a measure element, following the encoding of all staves. The required attribute form specifies the direction of the symbol by taking one of two possible values: cres (growing louder) or dim (getting softer). <hairpin form=\"cres\"\/> Marking the logical extent of hairpins is possible using the same attributes as for dynam . <hairpin form=\"cres\" layer=\"1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"2.5\" tstamp2=\"1m+1\"\/> The following example from Béla Bartók’s Mikrokosmos , Sz.107 shows a diminuendo between two staves that begins on the first beat (in the current measure) and ends on the first one in the penultimate measure. The duration is highlighted with a dashed line, which can be indicated with the extender attribute.

The most common tuplet is a so-called ‘triplet’, in which three notes take the time normally occupied by two. The relation of the tuplet to the underlying meter is specified using the num and numbase attributes, where num specifies the number of replacing notes and numbase specifies the number of notes of the same duration to be replaced. For example, when three eighth notes replace one quarter note in common time, num takes a value of \"3\", whereas numbase reads \"2\", because a quarter note in common time is normally divided into two eighths. When three quarters replace two in the same meter, numbase also reads \"2\". The combination of these attributes may be read as \"3 in the time of 2\" in either case. Tuplet rhythms from Maurice Ravel’s Boléro <tuplet num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\"> <note dur=\"16\"\/> <note dur=\"16\"\/> <note dur=\"16\"\/> <\/tuplet> The duration of the entire tuplet may be encoded using the usual ‘power of 2’ values, e.g. , 1, 2, 4, etc., in the dur attribute if necessary. <layer> <tuplet dur=\"2\" num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <note accid=\"s\" dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"\/> <\/tuplet> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"d\"\/> <\/layer> Tuplets are often highlighted using brackets above or below the affected notes. The presence and position of these brackets can be encoded using the bracket.place (above \/ below) and bracket.visible (true \/ false) attributes. Usually, however, tuplets are rendered with a bracket ( bracket.visible =\"true\") and a single number ( num.format =\"count\" and num.visible =\"true\"), as seen in the example above. However, the number-to-numbase ratio may be provided in addition to, or in some cases as a replacement for, the bracket. The num.format attribute indicates whether a plain number (the value of num ) or a ratio (comprised of num and numbase , e.g. , \"3:2\") should be displayed and num.visible indicates the general presence of such a number. Further visual control comes with the num.place and bracket.place attributes, that allow specific placement of the number and the bracket above or below the staff. In addition to note elements, tuplet may contain other elements, such as rest or space , to match the content of a source document or an intended rendering. In particular, the beam element is allowed so that custom beaming may be indicated, e.g. , a septuplet may be divided into a group of three plus a group of four notes. The tuplet element may also be used for repetition of the same pitch; that is, a single note or chord may be the only content of the tuplet. In some cases, optical music recognition software may treat these instances as bowed tremolandi due to the knowledge of the complete semantics of the notation at the time of recognition. However, marking these as tuplets is the recommended practice. In some situations, a tuplet is made up of events in different measures. As this raises the issue of non-concurrent hierarchies, it is not possible to encode such situations with the tuplet element described above. Therefore, MEI offers the tupletSpan element, which is member of the model.controlEventLike class. It is nested inside of measure , following all the measure’s staff children. It uses the same attributes as tuplet to describe tuplets, but instead of nesting all affected notes inside itself, it references the xml:id values of all affected notes in its plist attribute and the initial and terminal notes of the tuplet using startid and endid attributes. This configuration allows tuplets to cross beams or measure boundaries. The following example demonstrates a typical example of such hierarchy-crossing tuplets: Hierarchy-crossing tuplets <tupletSpan num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\" startid=\"#rest\" endid=\"#note2\" plist=\"#rest #note1 #note2\"\/>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnTuplets","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1 Articulation and Performance Instructions in CMN","desc":" artic arpeg bend bTrem fermata fTrem gliss octave","remarks":"This section introduces elements and attributes which may hold CMN-specific performance instructions.

This behavior, called arpeggiation, is normally indicated using a vertical wavy line preceding the chord. MEI offers the arpeg element to describe arpeggios. This element is a member of the model.controlEventLike.cmn class and, like other members of this class, uses the staff , layer and tstamp or the startid and plist attributes to connect it to the affected chord. <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer> <note dur=\"4\"\/> <note dur=\"4\"\/> <chord dur=\"4\"> <!-- notes omitted --> <\/chord> <note\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <arpeg staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"\/> <\/measure> For arpeggios that involve chords spanning multiple staves as a continuous arpeggio (instead of two separate arpeggios), the plist attribute should be used to point to all affected chord and single note elements’ xml:id attributes. Therefore, the use of the plist attribute is sufficient in many cases, so that other attributes from above may be omitted. Spanning arpeggios in Liszt’s Mazeppa study <arpeg xml:id=\"ex-0149852838\" plist=\"#ex-0731379794 #ex-1553574041\" \/> <arpeg xml:id=\"ex-1483377242\" plist=\"#ex-1474174387 #ex-0553655856\" \/> The usual direction for the performance of an arpeggio is from lowest note to highest, but this is not always the case. The customary signal of an downward arpeggio is an arrowhead added to the bottom of the wavy line. The indication of the presence of an arrowhead and the direction of the arpeggio are handled separately, however. The arrow attribute indicates the presence of an arrowhead in the arpeggiation sign, while the order attribute records the preferred sequence of notes. Béla Bartók uses a wavy line behind the chord to indicate a downward arpeggio. In such cases, the ho attribute can be used to indicate the offset from the usual position. The following examples illustrate various ways in which the arrow and order attributes may be employed. The default visual rendition and performance are assumed in the absence of both attributes, while the typical downward arpeggio is indicated by the presence of both attributes. The last two possibilities occur less frequently, but are sometimes appropriate: The presence of the arrow attribute without the order attribute may be used in those cases where the arrowhead is redundant but is added to the symbol for the sake of consistency or when the direction of successive arpeggios changes frequently. The last possibility, an order attribute without an arrow attribute, is ambiguous; however, it can be used as an encoding shortcut since a downward arpeggio must have a visual indication of its direction to distinguish it from the upward arpeggio; therefore, the presence of the arrowhead can be implied. <!-- default visualization and performance --><arpeg staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"\/> <!-- downward arpeggio with arrow added to visual symbol --><arpeg arrow=\"true\" order=\"down\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"\/> <!-- default rendition with (redundant) arrow added to the top of the visual symbol --><arpeg arrow=\"true\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"\/> <!-- downward arpeggio with no visual indication of order --><arpeg order=\"down\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"3\"\/> A third, and somewhat counter-intuitive, value for order , nonarp , indicates that no arpeggio shall be performed. Normally rendered as a bracket instead of a wavy line, this form of arpeggio is used to indicate a non-arpeggiated chord intervening in a sequence of arpeggiated ones. This is common in music for the harp, where arpeggiation is the usual method of performing chords and deviation from the norm must be explicitly indicated. Whereas an arpeggio ‘staggers’ the onset times of the notes of a chord, a glissando denotes a situation where the pitch ‘slides’ from one note to another. It makes no difference whether this slide produces distinct intermediate pitches (as on the piano) or not (as on the trombone), though the latter is sometimes referred to as portamento. The visual appearance of a glissando, which MEI encodes as gliss , is normally a line connecting two notes in the glissando. A simple glissando in Tárrega’s Alborada from a leading grace note <gliss startid=\"#startgliss\" endid=\"#endgliss\"\/> The gliss element is a member of the model.controlEventLike class and therefore, like other control events, it occurs inside a measure after the staves and uses its staff , layer , tstamp , tstamp2 , startid and endid attributes to connect it to the affected notes or chords.

The first is a rapid repetition of a single pitch or chord, whereas the second is a rapid alternation between two different notes or chords. In addition, either species of tremolo may be measured or unmeasured. A measured tremolo is an abbreviation for written-out notation; that is, the tremolo is intended to be perceived as notes with distinct rhythmic values. On the other hand, in an unmeasured tremolo no specific number of alternations is intended. For the repetition of a single note or chord, MEI offers the bTrem (bowed tremolo) element, which is a member of the model.eventLike.cmn class, meaning it is encoded following the normal course of musical events within a layer . It holds exactly one note or chord element that is to be repeated.

The example above shows a short excerpt from the second movement of Franz Schubert’s String Quartet in G major, D. 887 . However, the number of slashes present on the note may disagree with the number of slashes that should be present according to the unitdur attribute, especially in music manuscripts. <bTrem unitdur=\"64\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" stem.mod=\"2slash\"\/> <\/bTrem> Note that within beams the number of slashes should be adjusted anyway. <beam> <bTrem unitdur=\"32\"> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"8\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" stem.mod=\"2slash\"\/> <\/bTrem> <bTrem unitdur=\"32\"> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"16\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"b\" stem.mod=\"1slash\"\/> <\/bTrem> <\/beam> The bTrem element can be used as shorthand for a tuplet consisting of repetitions of a single note or chord. This kind of markup may be the result of an optical music recognition process in which complete semantics cannot be determined a priori . When used this way, the num attribute on bTrem can record a number to be rendered along with the pseudo-tuplet. In spite of this capability, the tuplet element is preferred. This makes the following examples’ visual appearance equal, but not necessarily their semantics. <bTrem num=\"3\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" stem.mod=\"3slash\"\/> <\/bTrem> <tuplet num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\"> <bTrem> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" stem.mod=\"3slash\"\/> <\/bTrem> <\/tuplet> In the case of alternating pitches, MEI offers the fTrem (fingered tremolo) element. While it mostly behaves the same as bTrem , a fingered tremolo requires exactly two child elements, either being a note or chord . The unitdur attribute value indicates the exact note values in an aural rendition of a measured tremolo, i.e. , 4ths, 8ths, 16ths, etc. The number of beams present in the source is captured by the beams attribute. Fingered tremolos <fTrem unitdur=\"32\"> <note pname=\"f\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\"\/> <note pname=\"a\" oct=\"4\" dur=\"4\"\/> <\/fTrem> Similar to bTrem , here the number of beams present may disagree with the rhythmic value indicated by the unitdur attribute, especially in manuscript sources.

It is usually written as a dot above or below an arc. It may stand above or below the staff it affects with its ‘open’ side usually facing towards the staff. A fermata indicates that a related note or rest should be held longer than its written duration would normally require. Sometimes, a fermata occurs over or under a bar line to indicate a pause or even the end of a phrase or section. The probably most famous fermatas in history from Beethoven’s fifth symphony In MEI, fermatas may be encoded using an attribute on elements like note , chord or rest . This attribute allows placement of a fermata above or below the element to which it’s attached. Fermatas in Mozart’s String Quartet K. 428 indicating general pauses <mRest fermata=\"above\"\/> However, if there is further (visual) information about the fermata that should be addressed in the encoding, MEI offers the fermata element. This element, which is a member of the model.controlEventLike.cmn class and therefore requires the use of such attributes as staff , layer , tstamp and startid , allows specification of the orientation of the fermata using its form attribute. In addition, the shape attribute may be used to indicate whether the fermata is rendered as the common semicircle (\"curved\"), a semisquare (\"square\"), or a triangle (\"angular\"). If the fermata should be rendered using some other symbol, a user-defined symbol may be referred to using an altsym attribute or the glyph.name and glyph.num attributes respectively. <fermata form=\"inv\" place=\"above\" shape=\"square\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"4\"\/> <fermata altsym=\"#myFermata.1\" place=\"above\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"5\"\/>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnFermata","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1.1 Octave Shift","desc":" octave","remarks":"An indication that a passage should be performed one or more octaves above or below its written pitch is represented by the octave element. <?xml-model href=\"https:\/\/music-encoding.org\/schema\/dev\/mei-all.rng\" type=\"application\/xml\" schematypens=\"http:\/\/relaxng.org\/ns\/structure\/1.0\"?> <?xml-model href=\"https:\/\/music-encoding.org\/schema\/dev\/mei-all.rng\" type=\"application\/xml\" schematypens=\"http:\/\/purl.oclc.org\/dsdl\/schematron\"?> <mei xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.music-encoding.org\/ns\/mei\" meiversion=\"6.0-dev\"> <meiHead> <fileDesc> <titleStmt> <title>Octave shift example<\/title> <\/titleStmt> <pubStmt> <date isodate=\"2023\">2023<\/date> <respStmt> <corpName>Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) Board<\/corpName> <\/respStmt> <availability> <useRestrict label=\"license\" auth=\"https:\/\/spdx.org\/licenses\/\" codedval=\"ECL-2.0\"> <p>Educational Community License v2.0<\/p> <\/useRestrict> <\/availability> <\/pubStmt> <seriesStmt> <title>MEI guidelines examples<\/title> <\/seriesStmt> <notesStmt> <annot>Example use of the \"octave\" element for octave shifts.

The settings for these pedals occur at the beginning of the harp notation and\/or whenever it is necessary to change the harp’s tuning. These settings may be rendered using letter pitches (in the order of the pedals from left to right) or in a diagrammatic fashion, such as the form invented by Carlos Salzedo . In MEI, harp pedal settings are encoded using the harpPedal element. It is a member of the model.controlEventLike.cmn class and is therefore placed within measure , following all staff children. The staff and layer attributes may be used to assign it to a certain staff or layer . Either a tstamp or startid attribute must be used to indicate the placement within the measure (see and for further details about those linking mechanisms). The musical intention of the element is described using the c , d , e , f , g , a and b attributes, which affect the corresponding strings of the harp. All of these attributes may take the values f (flat), s (sharp) or n (natural), where a natural is the default value, which is assumed when one of these attributes is not specified. Harp pedal diagrams <measure> <!-- staves omitted --> <harpPedal tstamp=\"1\" c=\"s\" b=\"f\" e=\"f\"\/> <\/measure> In the first diagram of the preceding example, the B, and E pedals are in the flat position, while the C pedal is in sharp position.

In MEI, these symbols are encoded using the pedal element. As a member of the model.controlEventLike.cmn class, it is located within measure and refers to a staff, layer and timestamp using the staff , layer and tstamp attributes. Alternatively, the startid attribute may be used to identify a note or chord to which the mark should be assigned. The meaning of the mark is captured using the dir attribute, which provides the following values: down depress the pedal up release the pedal bounce release, then immediately depress the pedal again half depress the pedal half way <measure> <!-- staves omitted --> <pedal dir=\"down\" staff=\"2\" tstamp=\"1\"\/> <\/measure> To specify the pedal, that has to be used, the func attribute allows the following values: sustain The sustain pedal, also referred to as the \"damper\" pedal, allows the piano strings to vibrate sympathetically with the struck strings. It is the right-most and the most frequently used pedal on modern pianos. (Often marked with: ) soft The soft pedal, sometimes called the \"una corda\", \"piano\", or \"half-blow\" pedal, reduces the volume and modifies the timbre of the piano. On the modern piano, it is the left-most pedal. sostenuto The sostenuto or tone-sustaining pedal allows notes already undamped to continue to ring while other notes are damped normally; that is, on their release by the fingers. This is usually the center pedal of the modern piano. (Often marked with: ) silent The silent or practice pedal mutes the volume of the piano so that one may practice quietly. It is sometimes a replacement for the sostenuto pedal, especially on an upright or vertical instrument.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnPedal","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1.1 Fingering","desc":" fing","remarks":"A common feature for keyboard music is fingering, indicating the finger, which should be used to play a single note.

An ossia often provides a simpler (easier to perform) version of the original content. Another frequent use case for ossia is the provision of indications about performance practice, such as an alternative version with ornamentation written out in full. In all cases, it is up to the performer to choose between the alternatives. Most often an ossia is rendered above the main staff on a reduced-size staff. Sometimes, however, the alternate material occurs on the same staff as the primary text, but in a separate layer. In this case, the alternative material is usually rendered in small-sized notation on the normal-sized staff. For both situations, MEI offers the ossia element, which may be nested either inside measure to reflect an ossia on a separate staff, or inside staff to reflect an inline ossia in a separate layer. The following example demonstrates an ossia on a separate staff: <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- first staff, without ossia --> <\/staff> <ossia> <oStaff> <!-- alternative content on reduced-size staff --> <\/oStaff> <staff n=\"2\"> <!-- original content on regular staff --> <\/staff> <\/ossia> <staff n=\"3\"> <!-- third staff, without ossia --> <\/staff> <\/measure> The example above shows a oStaff element and a staff element within ossia . This mechanism allows one to distinguish between the \"regular\" and the \"alternative\" content: The normal staff goes in line with the preceding measure’s staff, the oStaff contains the alternative and is printed in reduced size above. In combination with the presence of an n attribute multiple simultaneous ossia staves may be encoded. All staves within ossia , even the alternative ones without a direct reference, obey the definitions of the associated staffDef , which can be derived from the value of the n attribute. Alternatively, a separate staffDef may be given at the beginning of the contained layer element(s). In case of an inline ossia, the alternative content is held in an oLayer element, as seen in the following example: <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <ossia> <layer n=\"1\"> <!-- original content in regular layer --> <\/layer> <oLayer> <!-- alternative content in separate layer --> <\/oLayer> <\/ossia> <\/staff> <staff n=\"3\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <\/measure>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnOssia","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1 Cue","desc":" layer","remarks":"Cue notes are smaller notes that usually occur in an orchestral or vocal part and are not to be played or sung by the corresponding musician, but by other instruments or singers.

Though it is possible to label the movement, etc. using a label attribute attached to the enclosing structural entity (that is, on mdiv or section ), it is often required to capture the exact position, spelling, or other features of the label as found in the underlying source material. In these cases, an element is necessary. Labels which address the tempo at which the music should be performed should be encoded using the tempo element, which is a specialized form of dir . tempo is a member of the model.controlEventLike class and as such occurs as a child of measure , following all staff children. Its staff , layer and tstamp attributes are used to ensure correct semantic positioning, and place indicates a visual position with respect to the staff. <measure n=\"1\"> <!-- all staves omitted --> <tempo place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\">Allegro moderato<\/tempo> <\/measure>","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnTempo","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1.1 Rehearsal marks","desc":" reh rend","remarks":"Rehearsal marks are another specialized kind of directive. Consisting of letters, numbers, or a combination of both, rehearsal marks are used in scores and corresponding performer parts to identify convenient points to restart rehearsal after breaks or interruptions. For this reason, they are often visually emphasized by placing them within a square or circle. In MEI, they are encoded using the reh element, which holds the textual content of the rehearsal mark. It is a member of the model.controlEventLike.cmn class. The visual rendition of the rehearsal mark, including the surrounding shape, may be captured using the rend element described in chapter . The following detail from an edition of Hector Berlioz’ Symphonie Fantastique shows a typical example: Rehearsal mark <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"3\"> <!-- content omitted --> <\/staff> <reh place=\"above\" staff=\"1\"> <rend rend=\"box\">37<\/rend> <\/reh> <\/measure> As rehearsal marks usually are placed at the beginning of a measure the tstamp attribute may be omitted.

Many musical forms rely on repetition (sometimes with modification) of distinct sections of the music. Repetition in this sense can be thought of as ‘structural’.

Many of these symbols are found in manuscripts and may be regarded as personal conventions of their respective authors. Some signs, however, have been widely adopted. For example, it is common to indicate the repetition of a single beat or an entire measure with one or more diagonal lines, sometimes with dots at the upper left and lower right, much like a percent sign. The illustration below contains the most common signs: Beat repeat signs In general, MEI places primary emphasis on the capture of the semantic meaning of symbols, not their visual rendition. In this case, the focus is on the material being repeated, for example, a beat, a measure, a 2-measure fragment, etc. The following elements are provided for this purpose: The beatRpt element is used to represent a single repeated beat. Its visual rendition can be recorded using the slash attribute. This attribute indicates the number of slashes required to render the appropriate repeat symbol, which, as demonstrated in the preceding figure, depends on the rhythmic content of the beat being repeated. When a beat that consists of a single note or chord is repeated, the repetition sign is typically rendered as a single thick, slanting slash; therefore, the value 1 should be used. The following values should be used when the beat is divided into even notes: 4ths or 8ths=1, 16ths=2, 32nds=3, 64ths=4, 128ths=5. When the beat is comprised of mixed duration values, the symbol is always rendered as 2 slashes and 2 dots. In addition to its indication of a repeated beat, the beatRpt element is sometimes used in popular music notation, especially in guitar or percussion parts, to indicate a repeated rhythmic pattern. The beatRpt element can be used, but when these parts require durations longer or shorter than a beat, note elements with appropriately-shaped note heads should be employed instead. The mRpt element is available for repetition of an entire measure. Like mRest , it must be the sole child of layer , no other events should be used. The n attribute of mRpt should not be used to record the number displayed above the measure in the figure below. Instead, the numbering of repetitions of the written-out measure can be enabled using the multi.number attribute available on the scoreDef and staffDef elements.

This practice mostly occurs in hand-written notation and usually involves the repetition of the second half of a measure in duple time. This element is necessary because the function of the symbol, not the visual symbol itself, is of primary importance. The following example from the beginning of Beethoven’s Waldstein sonata illustrates such usage: Half-measure repeat <section> <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <!-- omitted --> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\"> <chord dur=\"2\" stem.mod=\"1slash\"> <note oct=\"2\" pname=\"g\"> <\/note> <note oct=\"1\" pname=\"b\"> <\/note> <\/chord> <halfmRpt\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <measure> <staff n=\"1\"> <!-- omitted --> <\/staff> <staff n=\"2\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <!-- omitted --> <\/layer> <layer n=\"2\"> <halfmRpt\/> <halfmRpt\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <\/measure> <\/section> As seen in the example above, it is possible to continuously repeat half measures, even across bar lines. The mRpt2 and multiRpt elements (like the multiRest element) never occur in scores, only in performer parts, where it is often necessary to abbreviate the notation due to page size limitations. Two-measure repetition Multi-measure repetition The mRpt2 element represents repetition of a 2-measure fragment, while multiRpt is for repetition of fragments longer than two measures. In modern publishing practice, repeats of more than two measures are written out using repeat signs. This element is provided, however, for handling non-standard practices often found in manuscripts. The num attribute on multiRpt records the number of preceding measures to be repeated. All elements described above allow for association of the sign with a symbol in a digital facsimile (via the facs attribute) and with a user-defined symbol (using altsym ). See and for further details. In addition, the expand attribute is available on the foregoing elements to inform a rendering process whether to use the repeat symbol or the full content represented by it. A value of true indicates that the content should be displayed, while a false value means to show only the repeat symbol.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnRepSym","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1 Common Music Notation Ornaments","desc":"","remarks":"This module includes elements and attributes for the encoding of ornaments typical of ‘Common Music Notation’ (CMN). Ornaments are formulae of embellishment that can be realized by adding supplementary notes to one or more notes of the melody. In written form, these are usually expressed as symbols written above or below a note, though some have a more complex written expression, such as those that involve multiple notes and\/or include grace notes. These symbols may have different resolutions depending on a large number of factors, such as historical context, national boundaries, composer, scribe, etc. The elements described here, therefore, are not bound to a specific symbol; they are, instead, meant to encode the encoder’s interpretation of a symbol and its position on the staff. Nonetheless, in order to establish common ground, the guidelines suggest commonly accepted symbols and realizations for the ornaments supported by MEI. The following sections will introduce each element in detail for all types of ornaments supported.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnOrnaments","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1 Encoding Common To All Ornaments","desc":" measure staff","remarks":"When encoding CMN, ornaments should be encoded within a measure , following the staff elements, and connected to events on the staff via attributes. The startid attribute is used to refer to the xml:id of the starting note. Additionally, if the ornament involves more than one events on the staff, the endid attribute can be used to anchor the ornament to a concluding event. The following example demonstrates the encoding of a mordent over a middle C: <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\" xml:id=\"co_1_n1\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <mordent place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" startid=\"#co_1_n1\"\/> <\/measure> Alternatively, the relationship of an ornament to a note can be expressed in terms of beats with the attribute tstamp . If the ornament involves more than one event on the staff, the tstamp2 attribute can be used to indicate the ending time stamp, as is explained in section . These methods may also be utilized simultaneously. The following example shows the use of tstamp for an ornament. Assuming that the following measure is in 2\/2, the ornament (in this case, a mordent) is related to the note on the second beat. <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note dur=\"2\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <mordent place=\"below\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\"\/> <\/measure> The relationship between an ornament and the notes on staff must always be encoded. It is, in fact, a semantic error not to specify a starting event or time stamp for an ornament. In their resolution, ornaments will involve auxiliary notes, which typically follow the key signature or the scale of the current key. When the ornament involves other chromatic auxiliaries, an accidental is expressed next to or above the ornament sign. The attributes accidlower and accidupper , available on all ornaments described in this chapter, can be used to record this accidental. The attribute values ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ indicate whether the accidental is associated with an upper or lower auxiliary note, not the position of the accidental sign.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnOrnamentsAll","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1.1 Overriding Default Resolutions","desc":" meiHead encodingDesc choice","remarks":"The symbols and sounded resolutions suggested for each ornament in this chapter are to be considered defaults. Nevertheless, because of the great historical and geographical variance in the notation of ornaments, the encoder is given methods to override the default resolutions. It is possible, for example, to specify in the meiHead a new default sounded resolution for an ornament. As discussed in the section , the element encodingDesc holds a description (optional, but recommended) of the methods and editorial principles which govern the transcription or encoding of the source material. Let us take a trill as an example. The section regarding does not set a specific number of alternations between the principal and secondary notes; the encoder, however, may specify an exact number in the encoding description. <encodingDesc> <editorialDecl> <p>All trills should be resolved by playing three alternations.<\/p> <\/editorialDecl> <\/encodingDesc> Alternatively, resolutions can be defined on a case-by-case basis by encoding a specific resolution using the choice element.

Two common types are supported: those mordents that involve a note lower than the principal note, and those that involve a note higher than the principal note. The attribute form accepts the following values: upper usually corresponding to the symbol: . This mordent is commonly performed as the principal note, followed by its upper neighbor, with a return to the principal note. lower usually corresponding to the symbol: .

A trill is encoded with the trill element and its attributes: Trills in modern notation are usually expressed with the abbreviation \"tr\" above a note on the staff. Often the abbreviation is followed by a wavy line that indicates the length of the trill. The following example demonstrates the encoding of simple trills: Example of simple trills. <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"up\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" stem.dir=\"up\"\/> <rest dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"e\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"\/> <trill accidupper=\"f\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\"\/> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"3.5\"\/> <trill accidupper=\"s\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"4\"\/> <\/measure> It has been specified earlier that it is a semantic error not to encode a starting event or time stamp for an ornament. This starting point of a trill can be expressed with the startid attribute and\/or with the tstamp attribute. Specifying the end point is not required, although the tstamp2 or endid attribute may be used to imply the use of a wavy line extender as shown in this example: Example of trills followed by wavy lines. <score> <scoreDef> <staffGrp> <staffDef clef.line=\"2\" clef.shape=\"G\" keysig=\"2f\" lines=\"5\" n=\"1\"\/> <\/staffGrp> <\/scoreDef> <section> <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" xml:id=\"n1\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\" xml:id=\"n2\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\" xml:id=\"n3\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\" xml:id=\"n4\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" startid=\"#n1\" endid=\"#n2\"\/> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" startid=\"#n2\" endid=\"#n3\"\/> <trill accidupper=\"n\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" startid=\"#n3\" endid=\"#n4\"\/> <trill accidupper=\"f\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" startid=\"#n4\" tstamp2=\"5\"\/> <\/measure> <\/section> <\/score> When giving an end point to trills, the extender attribute should also be added, to indicate the presence or absence of a line extender. Notice, that the note referenced in endid is not part of the trill itself, just like in glissandos . Chromatic alterations of auxiliary notes are occasionally expressed on the staff using small notes enclosed in parentheses, as shown in the example below. However, the attribute accidupper is still to be used to encode the alteration. Display of the auxiliary note in this ‘cautionary’ manner is left to down-stream rendering processes.

In such cases, the trill is encoded as in previous examples and associated with the principal note. Starting or concluding turns are notated on the staff (in layer ) as .

Strategies to clarify the encoding and interpretation of ornaments have been discussed in section above. However, in order to aid the encoder in making educated choices in the encoding of non-standard trills, this section shows two examples diverging from modern standard use. The abbreviation \"tr\" followed by a wavy line spanning multiple notes is sometimes used to indicate multiple trills: Example of multiple trills. The encoding of this kind of trill may vary depending on the purpose of the encoding. For representation of the source, a single trill is sufficient: <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"up\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" stem.dir=\"up\"\/> <rest dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"e\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"0m+4\"\/> <\/measure> To support analytical and aural rendering applications, however, each trill may be explicitly encoded, as the following example demonstrates: <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"f\" stem.dir=\"up\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"4\" pname=\"a\" stem.dir=\"up\"\/> <rest dur=\"8\"\/> <note dur=\"8\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"e\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"\/> <trill accidupper=\"f\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\"\/> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"3.5\"\/> <trill accidupper=\"s\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"4\"\/> <\/measure> However, when it is necessary to support multiple outputs, use of the choice element and appropriate sub-elements is recommended. In this case, the orig and reg elements can be used to represent the original source and a regularization provided by the editor, respectively: <choice> <orig> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\" tstamp2=\"0m+4\"\/> <\/orig> <reg> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"\/> <trill accidupper=\"f\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"2\"\/> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"3.5\"\/> <trill accidupper=\"s\" place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"4\"\/> <\/reg> <\/choice> Another situation that requires disambiguation of an ornament’s name and its potential rendition is due to the fact that the symbols for trills and mordents have been often used interchangeably in the past. The following example, taken from Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach (1720), shows a trill ( Trillo ) identified by the symbol associated with a mordent in modern practice. Nonetheless, J.S. Bach’s suggested resolution should be encoded with a variant of the procedure presented above. In the example below, the child elements of choice ; that is, orig and reg , represent non-exclusive options; that is, both may be processed by applications that aim to support both visual and aural renditions. Trill transcribed from J. S. Bach’s Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach <measure n=\"1\"> <staff n=\"1\"> <layer n=\"1\"> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <\/layer> <\/staff> <choice> <orig> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"\/> <\/orig> <reg> <note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\"\/> <note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\"\/> <note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\"\/> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"16\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"\/> <\/reg> <\/choice> <\/measure> Depending on the purpose of the encoding, it may be more convenient to encode the regularized text within the stream of events, along with a corresponding choice with regard to the existence of the trill marking, as in the following example: <measure> <staff> <layer> <choice> <orig> <note dur=\"4\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\" stem.dir=\"down\"\/> <\/orig> <reg> <note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\"\/> <note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\"\/> <note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"\/> <note dur=\"32\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"d\"\/> <note dots=\"1\" dur=\"16\" oct=\"5\" pname=\"c\"\/> <\/reg> <\/choice> <\/layer> <\/staff> <choice> <orig> <trill place=\"above\" staff=\"1\" tstamp=\"1\"\/> <\/orig> <reg> <\/reg> <\/choice> <\/measure> The orig element contains the single-note-with-trill transcription of the original text, while the reg element represents the realization-without-trill version. This approach facilitates substitution of the realization of the trill for the original written note (as well as the opposite procedure) and is therefore the recommended markup for applications where exchange of this kind is desirable.","url":"content\/cmn.html#cmnOrnamentsTrillsSpecial","type":"chapter"},{"ident":"2.1.1 Turns","desc":" turn att.turn.log att.ornamentAccid","remarks":"A turn is an ornament that typically consists of four notes: the upper neighbor of the principal note, the principal note, the lower neighbor, and the principal note again.
