This chapter describes the use of attributes that capture data which may be useful
for
analytical purposes. The analysis module provides attributes that record relationships
between
entities found in the encoding. These attributes may be used differently by different
users,
depending on the purpose of the analysis. These Guidelines recommend that encoders
employ
commonly accepted analytical practices, such as "functional analysis" or "Schenkerian
analysis",
and document their use in the {% include link elem="encodingDesc" %} described in section {% include link id="headerEncodingDescription" %}. For general information on musical analysis, please
consult Grove Music Online, "[Analysis](http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/41862pg1#S41862.1){:.link_ref}".
