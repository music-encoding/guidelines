A paragraph is a structural unit of a larger text. Usually, it is typographically
distinct;
that is, it usually begins on a new line and the first letter of the content is often
indented, enlarged, or both. This element has a similar meaning as the corresponding
elements in Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and
HTML.



{% include desc elem="p" %}




In MEI, a {% include link elem="p" %} is used in many different situations, including
transcriptional use within a {% include link elem="titlepage" %} or descriptive purposes as in a
{% include link elem="changedesc" %}.
