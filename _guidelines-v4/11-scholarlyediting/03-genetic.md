Genetic editions try to trace the creation of a (musical) work in all its recorded details, from the first sketches to the ‘final’ complete text. The aim of genetic textual criticism is to investigate compositional working and thinking processes - the genesis of compositions. In contrast to traditional scholarly editions, which focus on the constitution of a performable text of a work, Genetic Textual Criticism focuses on the process of production, the gradual elaboration of musical thoughts while writing. It is dependent on the availability of comprehensible traces of these writing processes. Genetic editions often have to deal with significant uncertainties, and they require a considerable amount of markup, as detailed below.
