{% include version-warning %}

The module described in this chapter offers the means to describe music in so-called ‘Common Music Notation’ (CMN, sometimes referred to as ‘Common Western Music Notation’). For this purpose, it provides a number of special elements and adds several attribute classes to elements from the {% include link id="shared" %} module.
