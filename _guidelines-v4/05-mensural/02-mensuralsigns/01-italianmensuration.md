The division of the breve in Italian trecento notation can be encoded using the **@divisio** attribute, which provides the values: ternaria, quaternaria, senariaimperf, senariaperf, octonaria, novenaria, duodenaria. The **@divisio** attribute would usualy replace the use of the **@tempus** and **@prolatio** set of attributes.

<!-- Later on (when approved in the schema) add the bracketed-and-percentage-expression: include desc atts="att.mensural.shared/divisio" -->

The signs for the Italian *divisiones* can be encoded in the **@sign** attribute, with the values: "t" for ternaria, "q" for quaternaria, "si" and "i" for senaria imperfecta, "sp" and "p" for senaria perfecta, "oc" for octonaria, "n" for novenaria, and "d" for duodenaria. And the additional values for senaria gallica, "sg" and "g", and senaria ytalica, "sy" and "y".
