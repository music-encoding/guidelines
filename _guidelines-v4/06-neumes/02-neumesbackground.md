Neume encoding in MEI was initially developed as part of the Hildegard von Bingen project at the University of Tübingen. MEI was chosen as the basic representation format after a [comparison of existing music encoding formats](http://www.dimused.uni-tuebingen.de/tuebingen_phase1_e.php){:.link_ref}. The initial work on this module was performed by Gregor Schräder [(Ein XML-Datenformat zur Repräsentation kritischer Musikedition unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von Neumennotation)](http://www.dimused.uni-tuebingen.de/downloads/studienarbeit.pdf){:.link_ref}, supervised by Prof. Stefan Morent.

Since 2012 a group of scholars has been working on the development of a new version of the MEI schema for neume notations (Ichiro Fujinaga, Jennifer Bain, Debra Lacoste, Kate Helsen, and Inga Behrendt). Afterwards other chant scholars joined the group bringing further expertise on other kinds of early music notations (namely Elsa De Luca, Alessandra Ignesti, and Sarah A. Long).
