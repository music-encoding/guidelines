Repetition is a characteristic feature of music. Many musical forms rely on repetition
(sometimes with modification) of distinct sections of the music. Repetition in this
sense
can be thought of as ‘structural’. At the same time, composers and
engravers of music often use local symbols for repeating smaller portions of music
instead
of writing them in full more than once. In this case, the repetition is better defined
as a
species of abbreviation.
