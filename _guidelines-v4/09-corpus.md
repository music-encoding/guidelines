The term corpus may refer to any collection of musical data, although it is often
reserved for collections which have been organized or collected with a particular
end in view,
generally to illustrate a particular characteristic of, or to demonstrate the variety
found in,
a group of related texts. The principal distinguishing characteristic of a corpus
is that its
components have been selected or structured according to some conscious set of design
criteria.

In MEI, a corpus is regarded as a composite text because, although each discrete document
in a
corpus clearly has a claim to be considered as a text in its own right, it is also
regarded as a
subdivision of some larger object, if only for convenience of analysis. In corpora,
the
component samples are clearly distinct texts, but the systematic collection, standardized
preparation, and common markup of the corpus often make it useful to treat the entire
corpus as
a unit, too. Corpora share a number of characteristics with other types of composite
texts,
including anthologies and collections. Most notably, different components of composite
texts may
exhibit different structural properties, thus potentially requiring elements from
different MEI
modules.

Aside from these high-level structural differences, and possibly differences of scale,
the
encoding of language corpora and the encoding of individual texts present identical
sets of
problems. Therefore, any of the encoding techniques and elements presented in other
chapters of
these Guidelines may therefore prove relevant to some aspect of corpus encoding and
may be used
in corpora.
