This {% include link elem="lg" %} (line group) element is used generically to encode any section of text that is organized as a group of lines. Following the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative, it is recommended to use it, along with the following elements, for marking up poetry:

  
{% include desc elem="lg" %} 
{% include desc elem="head" %} 
{% include desc elem="l" %} 
 

Because {% include link elem="lg" %} groups verses, it can be used to encode additional stanzas not integrated into the music notation. In addition, it is common for a poem to include a title or a header, as is demonstrated by the following example:
{% include mei example="text/text-sample337.xml" valid="true" %}
