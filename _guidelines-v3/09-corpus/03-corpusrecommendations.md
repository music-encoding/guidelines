title: "Recommendations for the Encoding of Large Corpora"

These Guidelines include proposals for the identification and encoding of a far greater variety of textual features and characteristics than is likely to be either feasible or desirable in any one corpus, however large and ambitious. For most large-scale corpus projects, it will therefore be necessary to determine a subset of recommended elements appropriate to the anticipated needs of the project; these mechanisms include the ability to exclude selected element types, add new element types, and change the names of existing elements.

Because of the high cost of identifying and encoding many textual features, and the difficulty in ensuring consistent practice across very large corpora, encoders may find it convenient to divide the set of elements to be encoded into the following four categories: 
ValueDescriptionrequired - texts included within the corpus will always encode textual features in this
          category, should they exist in the textrecommended - textual features in this category will be encoded wherever economically and
          practically feasible; where present but not encoded, a note in the header should be
          made.optional - textual features in this category may or may not be encoded; no conclusion about
          the absence of such features can be inferred from the absence of the corresponding element
          in a given text.proscribed - textual features in this category are deliberately not encoded; they may be
          transcribed as unmarked up text, or represented as gap elements, or
          silently omitted, as appropriate.
