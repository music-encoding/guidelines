This chapter describes methods for encoding textual content with MEI. Textual information
on
scores has several different uses, although some text is closer to music notation
than other
kinds. For example, tempo marks, directives and lyrics are directly related to the
functionality
of the notated music and are, therefore, described in other chapters (see for example
{% include link id="lyricsDesc" %} and {% include link id="sharedTextDirectives" %}). This chapter, on the other
hand, focuses on the text that accompanies the score, i.e., paratext (prefatory material,
title
pages, back matter, appendices, etc.), titles, prose, poetry, etc.

Most of the elements described here take inspiration from encoding formats that deal
primarily
with text, such as HTML and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). These elements are
provided to
encode relatively basic textual information. For deeper encoding of text, these Guidelines
recommend consideration of other text-specific encoding formats with embedded MEI
markup.
