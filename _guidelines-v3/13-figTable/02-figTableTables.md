The element [table](/{{ page.version }}/elements/table.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} contains text displayed in tabular form, i.e., in
rows and columns. A table is the least ‘graphic’ of the elements discussed
in this chapter. Almost any text structure can be presented as a series of rows and
columns:
one might, for example, choose to show a glossary or other form of list in tabular
form,
without necessarily regarding it as a table. When tabular presentation is regarded
as of less
intrinsic importance, it is correspondingly simpler to encode descriptive or functional
information about the contents of the table, for example to identify one cell as containing
a
name and another as containig a date, though the two methods may be combined. 

The [table](/{{ page.version }}/elements/table.html){:.link_odd_elementSpec} element may appear both within other components (such as
paragraphs), or between them, provided that the module defined in this chapter has
been
enabled. It is to a large extent arbitrary whether a table should be regarded as a
series of
rows or as a series of columns. For compatibility with currently available systems,
however,
these Guidelines require a row-by-row description of a table.

While rows and columns are always encoded in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, formatting
properties such as those provided by CSS may be used to specify that they should be
displayed
differently.
