         <td>CGM: Computer Graphics Metafile</td>
         <td> - This vector graphics format is specified by an ISO standard, ISO 8632:1987, amended
            in 1990. It defines binary, character, and plain-text encodings; the non-binary forms
            are safer for blind interchange, especially over networks. Documentation is available
            from ISO and from its member national bodies, such as AFNOR, ANSI, BSI, DIN, JIS,
            etc.
