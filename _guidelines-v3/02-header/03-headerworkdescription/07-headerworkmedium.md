The following elements are available for description of a composition's performing forces:

{% include desc elem="perfMedium" %} 
{% include desc elem="perfResList" %} 
{% include desc elem="castList" %} 

The {% include link elem="perfMedium" %} element provides the possibility of describing a work in terms of its medium of performance; that is, the performing forces required. In the case of a dramatic work, the dramatis personae and associated voice qualities may be enumerated using {% include link elem="castList" %}. The {% include link elem="perfResList" %} element describes the necessary instrumental and vocal resources.
