{% include desc elem="projectDesc" %} 

The {% include link elem="projectDesc" %} element may be used to describe, in prose, the purpose for which a digital resource was created, together with any other relevant information concerning the process by which it was assembled or collected. This is of particular importance for corpora or miscellaneous collections, but may be of use for any text, for example to explain why one kind of encoding practice has been followed rather than another.

For example:

{% include mei example="header/header-sample050.xml" valid="true" %}
