Mapping elements from the MEI metadata header to another descriptive system may help
a
repository harvest selected data from the MEI file to build a basic catalog record.
For this
purpose, the following attribute is provided on most meiHead elements:



{% include desc atts="att.bibl/analog" %}




The encoding system to which fields are mapped must be specified in **@analog**. When
possible, subfields as well as fields should be specified, e.g., subfields within
MARC
fields.
