This chapter describes the MEI module used for the encoding of names (names of persons
or
corporations/organizations) or descriptive phrases for styles, periods or geographical
indications. In section {% include link id="sharedNamesNumbersDates" %} it was noted that the elements
provided in the core module allow an encoder to specify that a given text segment
is a proper
noun. The elements provided by the present module allow the encoder to supply a detailed
sub-structure for such proper nouns, and to distinguish explicitly between persons
and
organizations, and between stylistic, periodical or geographical indications.

The chapter begins by discussing the elements provided for the encoding of names ({% include link elem="name" %}) and dates ({% include link elem="date" %}) in general and finishes by
addressing more specific elements for corporate names ({% include link elem="corpName" %}),
geographic names ({% include link elem="geogName" %}), period names ({% include link elem="periodName" %}), personal names ({% include link elem="persName" %}) and style names ({% include link elem="styleName" %}). In general it is recommended to use standardized forms of proper
nouns and to record the names and web-accessible locations of the controlled vocabularies
used.
There are several commonly-referenced authority files, especially for geographical,
organizational and personal names, such as the Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND), the Library
of
Congress Authorities, the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN), and the MARC
code list for
relators. Recommendations on which standards could be used can be found in the descriptions
of
the individual elements.
