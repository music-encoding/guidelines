The {% include link elem="name" %} and {% include link elem="date" %} elements may be used to mark up portions of a text that function as names or dates.

  
{% include desc elem="name" %} 
{% include desc elem="date" %} 
 

The {% include link elem="name" %} element is intended for generic applications and may be used to identify any named entity, such as a person, item, application, place, etc. The namesDates module documented in {% include link id="namesDates" %} offers the more specific elements {% include link elem="persName" %}, {% include link elem="corpName" %} and {% include link elem="geogName" %}.
