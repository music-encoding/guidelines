A specialized element is furnished for the capture of titlepage information.



{% include desc elem="titlePage" %}




The {% include link elem="titlePage" %} element, modelled after a similar element in Encoded
Archival Description (EAD), may occur within the textual matter preceding or following
the
musical content of the encoding. Since a diplomatic transcription of the titlepage
is often
necessary to accurately identify musical material contained within a source, {% include link elem="titlePage" %} may also be used within the metadata header as a child of the
{% include link elem="physDesc" %} element.
